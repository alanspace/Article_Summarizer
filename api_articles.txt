Content: scientists in theUS have developed a technology that can detect land mines from far away and with high accuracy, potentially lowering the risk of removing mines from current and former conflict zones. Known as the Laser Multibeam Differential Interferometry Sensor, or Lambdis, the tech works by shining lasers onto the ground to reveal suspected threats. There are currently more than110 million land minesburied across the world, and in 2023, mines killed or injured5,700 people, with civilians making up 84 percent of casualties—half of which were children. According to the United Nations, land mines threaten lives in more than 70 countries. A mine can be made for just $3, but removing one can cost up to $1,000. Land mine removal usually relies on humans finding them with handheld metal detectors, which is dangerous, time-consuming, and nearly ineffective if hunting for mines made from plastic. In response, US researchers developed a technology to detect land mines indirectly, and which could detect both metal and plastic mines. Lambdis works by sending a vibration into the ground while at the same time scanning the area with a laser beam. Materials in the ground will vibrate at different frequencies, as will the soil itself, and these differences are picked up by the laser when it is reflected back to its emitter. The Lambdis system then generates an image that visualizes these vibrations and their locations in different colors—creating a map of things buried in the soil. The technology was developed by a team led by Vyacheslav Aranchuk, a specialist in laser sensing at the University of Mississippi. Importantly, it can detect mines from a distance, and can be mounted on a moving vehicle to aid with scanning large areas. “The number of land mines will continue to increase as long as conflicts continue. This technology will be useful not only for military use in ongoing conflicts, but also for humanitarian efforts after conflicts have ended,” says Aranchuk. The researchers are continuing to develop the system. An earlier version of Lambdis emitted 30 laser beams in a line, but the latest version emits beams in a 34 x 23 matrix, allowing it to visualize vibrations over a wider area. Conventional metal detectors used for de-mining react to any metal object, so it is not uncommon for them to mistakenly detect things other than land mines. And an alternative de-mining solution, underground radar, which emits high-frequency electromagnetic waves into the ground, has the disadvantage of being easily affected by the condition of the soil. Lambdis, in comparison, produces fewer false positives. According to the research team, the tech can be used not only for land mine detection, but also to evaluatecivil engineering structures such as bridgesfor structural integrity or damage. In the future it could be used to analyze products in the automotive and aerospace industries, or even in medical imaging. Next, the team plans to evaluate the performance of Lambdis in different soil conditions and when hunting for other types of buried objects.

Title: The Beginning of the End of Big Tech

Please also considersubscribing to WIRED Next year willbe Big Tech’s finale. Critique of Big Tech is now common sense, voiced by a motley spectrum that unites opposing political parties, mainstream pundits, and even tech titans such as the VC powerhouseY Combinator, which is singing in harmony with giants like a16z in proclaiming fealty to “little tech” against the centralized power of incumbents. This story is from theWIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. Why the fall from grace? One reason is that the collateral consequences of the current Big Tech business model are too obvious to ignore. The list is old hat by now: centralization, surveillance, information control. It goes on, and it’s not hypothetical. Concentrating such vast power in a few hands does not lead to good things. No, it leads to things like theCrowdStrike outageof mid-2024, whencorner-cutting by Microsoftled to critical infrastructure—fromhospitalsto banks totraffic systems—failing globally for an extended period. Another reason Big Tech is set to falter in 2025 is that the frothy AI market, on which Big Tech bet big, is beginning to lose its fizz. Major money, like Goldman Sachs and Sequoia Capital, is worried. They went public recently with their concerns about the disconnect between the billions required to create and use large-scale AI, and the weak market fit and tepid returns where the rubber meets the AI business-model road. It doesn’t help that the public and regulators are waking up to AI’s reliance on, and generation of, sensitive data at a time when the appetite for privacy has never been higher—as evidenced, for one, by Signal’s persistent user growth. AI, on the other hand, generally erodes privacy. We saw this in June whenMicrosoft announced Recall, a product that would, I kid you not, screenshot everything you do on your device so an AI system could give you “perfect memory” of what you were doing on your computer (Doomscrolling? Porn-watching?). The system required the capture of those sensitive images—which would not exist otherwise—in order to work. Happily, these factors aren’t just liquefying the ground below Big Tech’s dominance. They’re also powering bold visions for alternatives that stop tinkering at the edges of the monopoly tech paradigm, and work to design and build actually democratic, independent, open, and transparent tech. Imagine! For example,initiativesin Europe are exploring independent core tech infrastructure, with convenings of open source developers, scholars of governance, and experts on the political economy of the tech industry. And just as the money people are joining in critique, they’re also exploring investments in new paradigms. Acropoftech investorsare developing models of funding formission alignment, focusing on tech that rejects surveillance, social control, and all the bullshit. One exciting model I’ve been discussing with some of these investors would combine traditional VC incentives (fund that one unicorn > scale > acquisition > get rich) with a commitment to resource tech’s open, nonprofit critical infrastructure with a percent of their fund. Not as investment, but as a contribution to maintaining the bedrock on which a healthy tech ecosystem can exist (and maybe get them and their limited partners a tax break). Such support could—and I believe should—be supplemented by state capital. The amount of money needed is simply too vast if we’re going to do this properly. To give an example closer to home, developing and maintaining Signalcosts around $50 milliona year, which is very lean for tech. Projects such as theSovereign Tech Fundin Germany point a path forward—they are a vehicle to distribute state funds to core open source infrastructures, but they are governed wholly independently, and create a buffer between the efforts they fund and the state. Just as composting makes nutrients from necrosis, in 2025, Big Tech’s end will be the beginning of a new and vibrant ecosystem. The smart, actually cool, genuinely interested people will once again have their moment, getting the resources and clearance to design and (re)build a tech ecosystem that is actually innovative and built for benefit, not just profit and control.

Title: The six-day police hunt for CEO killing suspect
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ewgp1qrqvo
Image URL: https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/653a/live/d6bdb000-b735-11ef-a64f-b3c7b6699fbc.jpg
Content: It wasn't DNA or facial recognition technology that cracked the case. Nor did amateur online sleuths make the breakthrough. In the end, it was a McDonald's restaurant employee - hours away from the scene of the crime - who spotted a man resembling a "person of interest" photo. The suspect was careful to wear a mask while traveling around New York City, but pulled it down for a second to flirt with a woman behind the desk at a youth hostel, and again to eat at McDonald's. That may have been enough. Police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, swooped into the restaurant and arrested Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old from a wealthy Baltimore-area family with a private and Ivy League education. After six dramatic days, the hunt for the man alleged to have gunned down  UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson was over. On Monday morning, a regular at the McDonald's in Altoona told the BBC that one of his friends spotted Mr Mangione as he entered the restaurant and commented: "There's that shooter from New York." "I thought he was kidding," the customer said. Police were called and when officers first approached Mr Mangione and asked him if he'd been in New York, he became "visibly nervous, kind of shaking", Altoona's Deputy chief of police Derick Swope told reporters. As he was being led into a court hearing on Tuesday, Mr Mangione shouted about an "insult to the American people and their lived experience". He now faces charges of second-degree murder along with weapons offences. New York police say the suspect first arrived in the city on 24 November, in the busy run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday. He visited the Hilton Hotel, where the shooting would later happen, and his encounter with a clerk at the hostel, where he stayed,  was captured on camera. Ten days later, on 4 December, Mr Thompson was shot dead on his way to a meeting at about quarter to seven in the morning. The suspect fled on foot, bike and taxi to a bus station near the George Washington Bridge. From there, he exited the city. The killing was identified as a targeted attack early on in the investigation. Video showed the suspect ignored several pedestrians on the busy Manhattan pavement and zeroed in on Mr Thompson. Shell casings at the scene had words written on them, thought to be references to the insurance industry: "delay", "deny", "depose". Mr Mangione comes from a large and wealthy family in Baltimore, Maryland, with business interests in nursing homes, real estate, a country club and a radio station,according to local news outlet the Baltimore Banner. He attended the all-male private Gilman School, where he graduated as  valedictorian – at the top of his class. A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school's standards. "Quite honestly, he had everything going for him," Mr Leatherbury said. Mr Mangione went on to the University of Pennsylvania. There he received bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a "super normal" and "smart person". He worked as a data engineer and a video game developer, and most recently was living in Hawaii. Social media posts show that friends and family members had recently been attempting to contact him and asking about his whereabouts. In a post on X from October, someone asked Mr Mangione: "Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you."  Monday's arrest ended a dramatic six days in which the alleged killer seemed to disappear, leaving few clues behind and eluding police. Not only was he able to leave one of the busiest cities in the world using public transport, before Monday his name was not publicly known. It's also unclear exactly where he was hiding in the days after he left New York. Juliette Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the US Department of Homeland Security, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his background in technology may have helped him evade capture for nearly a week. "This was someone who was studying how law enforcement and how these cities try to protect themselves, which is essentially they have lots of cameras around," she said. "Now that we know a little bit about him - that he's a smart person, he went to great schools, he had higher degrees, he studied engineering technology, he was into electronic gizmos - some of it is beginning to make sense," Kayyem said. The suspect also wore a face mask almost constantly, and Mr Mangione was found with a fake driving licence and an untraceable "ghost gun" – a firearm assembled by the owner without a serial number, which police said may have been 3D-printed. Authorities said he used cash for purchases in New York City and fled the scene of the crime into Central Park, where there are few surveillance cameras. But he also appeared to make some elementary mistakes – including revealing his face in the hostel, and holding on to the gun and the fake identification card. The Mr Mangione family released a statement Monday night through Mangione's cousin, a Maryland state lawmaker. "Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest," said Nino Mangione. "We offer prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved." Mr Mangione's online footprint shows few messages about healthcare or the insurance industry. Instead there are comments about artificial intelligence and technology, science and pop philosophy, and reviews of a range of books, including 1984 and the Harry Potter series. But a number of social media accounts matching his name and picture offer some potential clues about his motivation. RJ Martin, a former roommate of Mr Mangione in Hawaii, said the suspect had a back injury, but he "never complained" about it. "His back injury prohibited him, at times, from just doing many normal things," Mr Martin said. The banner image on Mr Mangione's X account shows an X-ray of a spine with hardware in it. Mr Martin, who eventually lost contact with Mr Mangione, said he believed his former friend "would have never conceived of hurting someone else".  And Mr Mangione's account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review website, indicated that he had read several books about managing back pain, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry. Also on the Goodreads site, Mr Mangione gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – better known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others. In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual who killed innocent people. However, he also argued that the essay should not be dismissed as the manifesto of a lunatic but rather the work of an "extreme political revolutionary". He quoted another online commentator who said: "When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive." Mr Mangione wrote that he found this viewpoint "interesting". Police said a three-page, handwritten document Mr Mangione had when he was arrested expressed "ill will" towards corporate America. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times that the document said: "These parasites had it coming" and "I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done". Meanwhile, mixed reactions to the shooting and Mr Mangione's arrest continue –  sympathy for Mr Thompson and his family versusanger at the state of America's expensive, vastly complicated healthcare system. Online, the shooting prompted some criticism of the medical insurance industry, and Mr Mangione was even hailed as a hero. Police in Altoona said the department received hundreds of emails and calls, including death threats. Some members of the public called police in support of Mr Mangione, claiming they were actually the killer and that police "have the wrong guy". And police are advising McDonald's employees not to give interviews or statements out of concern for their safety. The restaurant received hundreds of negative reviews online, calling employees "rats" and criticising them for calling the police. Similar sentiments have been expressed online, often in posts by anonymous accounts. But others have condemned such sentiments. "In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint," Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told reporters. "I understand people have real frustration with our healthcare system… But I have no tolerance, nor should anyone, for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters most. "In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this: He is no hero," Shapiro said. With reporting by Cai Pigliucci, Jessica Parker and Madeline Halpert The woman fatally set alight on a Brooklyn train was attacked by a man she is not believed to have known. A draft details evidence of alleged drug use and payments for sex - which the former US congressman denies. The president condemns the murderers but says the death penalty at federal level "must stop". It prompts a sharp rebuke from Panama's president, who says "every square metre" of the canal belongs to his country. The US Homeland Security Secretary says rhetoric about the murder suspect is concerning. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Image credit: Netflix DOWNLOAD PDF VERSION Wallace and Gromit are returning to our screens this Christmas, but with them comes an arguably even more hotly-awaited guest appearance: that villainous penguin, Feathers McGraw. Yes, the glove-hats are off inAardman'sWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, in which we see Wallace grappling with his reputation as an evil inventor. Things get worse when he creates a “smart” gnome that develops a mind of its own, and he and Gromit make the shocking discovery that a vengeful figure from their past may be the mastermind behind their downfall. It's been 31 years since Feathers McGraw first blessed our screens, and in that time, filmmaking technology has come a long way. But what about that age-old art form of stop motion? And how does it actually work? It begins with preproduction, crafting your story and characters on paper long before you start making physical models. It took theWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowlteam around a year to perfect this stage, which is crucial, as doing retakes isn’t really an option in stop motion. Once the folks at Aardman have a rough impression of what the film’s going to look like, they create multiple puppets for each character in different scales, as well as creating the physical sets. Modeling clay is a good place to start, and you can build up a character bit by bit if needed.  Stop motion also requires a physical set, and for their scale of operation, Aardman needs ones that can break apart to give animators access to the puppets, as they're going to be handling thema lot. So, if you’re just starting out, creating a smaller a small stage for the story will make things easier. In the same way that you would block a stage play, animators will establish the route of movement of the characters, and then the action begins. They use rigs and scaffolding to keep their characters moving across the landscape, holding them in place so that the animators can work their magic. Stop-motion animation is one of the oldest styles of animation. It involves shooting lots of frames in which objects change incrementally, creating minute adjustments that can be run together to create the appearance of fluid movement. The fundamental principle of stop motion has remained pretty much the same since it was used inThe Humpty Dumpty Circus, a short film thought to be the first to use the technique that was regrettably lost. An early example you can still watch isFun In A Bakery Shop, which was released in 1902 and used a “lightning sketch” version of claymation – the art of manipulating malleable materials like clay in stop motion. People have used things other than clay, too, such asWładysław Starewiczwho used dead insects; and photos, as demonstrated by this incrediblefilm about the Apollo missions. To find out more about what it’s like working on such a complex set, we spoke to co-founder and creative director ofWallace & Gromitat Aardman – Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, respectively – about their process when creating films for stop motion, how the technology has come along. Plus, there are some top tips for anyone who fancies giving stop motion a go. The key takeaway? “Roll up your sleeves and get started!”  Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowlwill be available on theBBCin the UK from Dec 25, and worldwide on Netflix fromJan 3.

Title: Groundbreaking technology converts cancer cells into normal cells

Image URL: https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/174318220-620x480.jpg
Content: Despite the development of numerous cancer treatment technologies, the common goal of current cancer therapies is to eliminate cancer cells. This approach, however, faces fundamental limitations, including cancer cells developing resistance and returning, as well as severe side effects from the destruction of healthy cells. KAIST (represented by President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 20th of December that a research team led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a groundbreaking technology that can treat colon cancer by converting cancer cells into a state resembling normal colon cells without killing them, thus avoiding side effects. The research team focused on the observation that during the oncogenesis process, normal cells regress along their differentiation trajectory. Building on this insight, they developed a technology to create a digital twin of the gene network associated with the differentiation trajectory of normal cells. Through simulation analysis, the team systematically identified master molecular switches that induce normal cell differentiation. When these switches were applied to colon cancer cells, the cancer cells reverted to a normal-like state, a result confirmed through molecular and cellular experiments as well as animal studies. This research demonstrates that cancer cell reversion can be systematically achieved by analyzing and utilizing the digital twin of the cancer cell gene network, rather than relying on serendipitous discoveries. The findings hold significant promise for developing reversible cancer therapies that can be applied to various types of cancer. The fact that cancer cells can be converted back to normal cells is an astonishing phenomenon. This study proves that such reversion can be systematically induced." Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho He further emphasized, "This research introduces the novel concept of reversible cancer therapy by reverting cancer cells to normal cells. It also develops foundational technology for identifying targets for cancer reversion through the systematic analysis of normal cell differentiation trajectories." This research included contributions from Jeong-Ryeol Gong, Chun-Kyung Lee, Hoon-Min Kim, Juhee Kim, and Jaeog Jeon, and was published in the online edition of the international journal Advanced Science by Wiley on December 11. (Title: "Control of Cellular Differentiation Trajectories for Cancer Reversion") DOI:https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202402132 The study was supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Mid-Career Researcher Program and Basic Research Laboratory Program.

Title: China's Dahua Technology to exit projects in Xinjiang

Content:    Manage your account  BEIJING (Reuters) - China's video surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology said that it and its subsidiaries have agreed to terminate or exit five projects they signed with local governments in China's Xinjiang region, a stock exchange filing showed on Monday. Some of the projects, awarded between 2016 and 2017, have been terminated in advance, while others were still in operation, Dahua said in a filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange. The company will cease operating the projects and proceed with asset disposal and debt resolution works, it said. Dahua did not give a reason for the withdrawal. Dahua's statement came after another Chinese surveillance camera manufacturer, Hikvision, said earlier this month it had exited contracts with five local governments in Xinjiang. It also did not say at the time why it was pulling out. The United States added Dahua and seven other tech firms to its trading blacklist in 2019 for allegedly being "implicated" in "repression and high-tech surveillance" against Uyghurs and other members of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Dahua had said the U.S. decision lacked "any factual basis." The Chinese government has repeatedly rejected allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and has criticised or targeted companies for removing firms operating in the region from their supply chains. (Reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Tomasz Janowski) Afghanistan’s Foreign Ministry on Monday welcomed the reopening of Saudi Arabia’s Embassy in Kabul for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday the situation with European countries that buy its gas through a transit deal via Ukraine was very complicated and needs more attention, a day after talks between President Vladimir Putin and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.  Ukraine has said it will not be renewing a five-year deal to pipe Russian gas to Europe, which is due to expire at the end of the year, as it does not want to aid Moscow's military effort.  The flow accounts for around half of Russia's total pipeline gas exports to Europe, with Slovakia, Italy, Austria and Czech Republic set to be most affected if it ends.

Retirement saving can be a daunting task. Providence Financial & Insurance Services president Anthony Saccaro joins Wealth to discuss optimal retirement strategies for different generations. For those 60 and older, Saccaro recommends "shift[ing] to more conservative investments" that yield interest and dividends because you can count on these, "but you can't count on growth." He cautions that despite current market trends, stability isn't guaranteed. "If it crashes at the wrong time, you might not be able to retire, and we just don't want that to happen." For individuals in their 40s, Saccaro emphasizes dollar-cost averaging as a primary investment strategy, combined with both Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs. "The clients that I have and the people that I talk to in retirement that are the happiest are people that have a balanced bucket of tax-free money and Roth IRAs and money that they have in pre-tax or traditional IRAs." Saccaro advises those in their 20s to "start the habit of saving," suggesting beginning with dollar-cost averaging at 10% just to "start saving something." He recommends Roth IRAs for long-term tax advantages and emphasizes the importance of saving for homeownership to eliminate rent payments during retirement.

Questions? New Partnerships James Skelton Technical Evangelist // AI Arcanist The promise of Large Language Model’s is becoming increasingly more apparent, and their use more and more prevalent, as the technology continues to improve. With the release of LLaMA 3, we are finally starting to see Open Source language models getting reasonably close in quality to the walled garden releases that have dominated the scene since the release of ChatGPT. One of the more enticing use cases for these models is as a writing aid. While even the best LLMs are subject to hallucinations and confident misunderstandings, the utility of being able to rapidly generate writing material on any well-known topic is useful for a multitude of reasons. As the scope of these LLM models training data increases in robustness and size, this potential only grows. The latest and most exciting applications that take advantage of this potential is Stanford OVAL’s STORM pipeline. STORM (Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking) models enact a pre-writing stage using a collection of diverse expert agents that simulate conversations about the topic with one another, and then integrate the collated information into an outline that holistically considers the agents perspective. This allows STORM to then use the outline to generate a full Wikipedia-like article from scratch on nearly any topic. STORM impressively outperforms Retrieval Augmented Generation based article generators in terms of organization and coverage of the material. In this article, we are going to show how to use STORM with VLLM hosted HuggingFace models to generate articles. Follow along to get a short overview of how STORM works before jumping into the coding demo. STORM is a pipeline which uses a series of LLM agents with the Wikipedia andYou.comsearch APIs to generate Wikipedia like articles on any subject, in high quality. To achieve this, the pipeline first searches Wikipedia for pertinent articles related to a submitted topic and extracts their table of contents to generate a novel outline on the topic. The information from these is then used to set up a series of subject-master, conversational agents to quickly prime an informed Wikipedia writer. The informed writer then writes the article using the outline as a scaffold. To start, STORM uses theyou.com search APIto access the Wikipedia articles for the LLM. To get started with STORM, be sure to setup your API key and add it tosecrets.tomlin the Notebook. For the LLM writer agents, we are going to leverage VLLM to run models downloaded to the cache fromHuggingFace.co. Specifically, we are going to be using Mistral’sMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.  (Source) From theSTORMarticle, here is a high-level overview of different approaches to the challenge of generating Wikipedia-like articles. To do this, most approaches use a technique called pre-writing. This is the discovery stage where the LLM gets parses through material for the topic together from separate sources. The first they considered is probably the most direct and obvious: an LLM agent generates a large amount of questions and queries the model with each. They are then recorded and ordered by the agent with subheaders to create the outline. The second method they mentioned is Perspective-Guided Question Asking. This process involves the model first discovering diverse perspectives thorugh analysis of different, but relevant, Wiipedia articles. The LLM is then personified by these perspectives, which allows for a more accurate formation of the direct prompting questions that would generate the article outline.  (Source) The third method is the one developed for the STORM release: Conversational Question Asking. This method involves an augmented form of Perspective-Guided Question Asking. The pipeline surveys “prompts an LLM to generate a list of related topics and subsequently extracts the tables of contents from their corresponding Wikipedia articles, if such articles can be obtained through Wikipedia API” (Source). The articles are then used to each provide a set number of perspectives to converse with the topic expert as Wikipedia writer agent. For each perspective, the Wikipedia writer and the topic expert simulate a conversation. After a set number of interactions, a topic-relevant question is generated with the context of the perspective and conversation history. The question is broken down into uncomplicated search terms, and the search results are used to exclude untrustworthy sources from being considered. The trustworthy search results are then synthesized together to generate the final answer to the question. The final question-answer interaction is then collated in a reference guide for the LLM to reference during the writing stage. The final outline uses the intrinsic knowledge to piece together the gathered knowledge from the references into a high quality article. After the pre-writing stage is completed and before writing, the LLM is first prompted to generate a generic outline for the article from the topic. This generic outline is then used along with the input topic again and the simulated conversations to generate an improved outline from the original. This is then used during writing to guide the Wikipedia writer. The article is generated piece by piece from each section of the outline. The final outputs are concatenated to generate the full article. To run STORM, there are a couple things we need to take care of first. To actually run the demo, we are going to need to sign up for theYou.comleverage the Web+News Search API. Use thelinkto sign up for the free trial, and get your API key. Save the key for later. Once we have taken care of that preparation, we can spin up our Notebook. We recommend the A6000 or A100-80G GPUs for running STORM, so that we can get our results in a reasonable time frame and avoid out of memory errors. Once your Notebook has spun up, open up a ipynb file to continue with the demo. Demo setup is very straightforward. We need to install VLLM and the requirements for STORM to get started. Run the first code cell, or paste this into a corresponding terminal without the exclamation marks at the start of each line. This process may take a moment. Once it is done, run the following code cell to log in toHuggingFace.coto get your API access tokens. The token can be access or created using the link given to you by the output. Simply copy and paste it into the cell provided in the output to add your token. With that complete, we will have access to any HuggingFace model we want to use. We can change this by editing the model id in the run_storm_wiki_mistral.py file on line 35 in themistral_kwargsvariable, and also changing the model ID we call for the VLLM client. To run STORM, the python script relies on API calls to input and receive outputs from the LLM. By default, this was set to use OpenAI. In the past few days, they have added functionality to enable DSPY VLLM endpoints to work with the script. To set this up, all we need to do is run the next code cell. This will launch Mistral as an interactive API endpoint that we can directly chat with. Once the API has launched, we can run STORM. Use the next section to see how to configure it. Now that everything is set up, all that is left for us to do is run STORM. For this demo, we are going to use their example run_storm_wiki_mistral.py. Paste the following command into a terminal window. From here, you will be asked to input a topic of your choice. This is going to be the subject of our new article. We tested ours with the inputted topic “NVIDIA GPUs”. You can read a sample section from our generated article below. As we can see, the formatting mimics that of Wikipedia articles perfectly. This topic is likely one that was not heavily covered in the original model training, considering the ironic nicheness of the subject matter, so we can assume that the correct information presented in the generated text was all ascertained through the STORM research procedure. Let’s take a look. As we can see, this is a pretty impressive distillation of the available information. While there are some smaller mistakes regarding the specifics of this highly complex and technical subject, the pipeline still was nearly completely accurate with its generated text with regard to the reality of the subject. The applications for STORM we displayed in this article are truly astounding. There is so much potential for supercharging educational and dry content creation processes through applications of LLMs such as this. We cannot wait to see how this evolves even further as the relevant technologies improve. Thanks for learning with the DigitalOcean Community.

Title: Why Soccer Players Are Training in the Dark
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/why-soccer-players-are-training-in-the-dark-okkolo-football-sunderland-leeds-united-neuroscience/
Image URL: 
Content: I stand inthe darkened silence of a rectangular chamber, 8 meters long and 6 meters wide, balanced on the tips of my toes. On the wall in front of me are the outlines of two circles. Beyond these walls is an enormous insulated hangar decked with artificial grass and filled with highly paid professional soccer players. The lower circle glows a brilliant white in the dim light. I brace, as though waiting for the Death Star to ready its superlaser. One second passes. Two seconds. Clunk—pause—whoosh! A soccer ball fires from the illuminated hole, accelerating to 35 miles per hour and shooting through the darkness, before slapping onto my right foot and spinning awkwardly off behind. I turn, and it takes another two touches before I’ve brought the ball fully under my control. A professional player would have managed it in one, and would have done so without making a sound. The next four balls are fired with similarly dismal outcomes. I fear that I am going to be escorted from the facility on the grounds of supreme incompetence. There is, however, a glimmer of hope. Okkulo, the English company that has created this training environment, has justpublished researchthat found that consistent training under restricted lighting can have remarkable effects on certain visual motor skills. Spend enough time doing drills in this specially lit environment, and I might just end up being a better player in the park on a Saturday afternoon. “The athlete will go inside of this box, and when they come out they’ll be better prepared for their match or for their training,” suggests Okkulo’s founder, Mel O’Connor. The idea is simple: The more you train the processes that coordinate the eyes, body, and brain during difficult light conditions, the faster and more refined their coordination should be under normal light. “We can speed up and slow down the information between the eye and the brain, and that in turn works with the [connection between] the brain and the muscle,” O’Connor says. “It’s about maximizing the processing power.” I am trialling Okkulo’s technology at Thorp Arch in West Yorkshire, a $6 million sports facility that serves as base camp for one of England’s top soccer clubs—Leeds United. Today, I’m using a temporary model designed to be toured around sports clubs and universities. It’s been here at Leeds for six weeks. Should they opt for a permanent installation, Okkulo’s in-house manufacturing process can create a bespoke model in collaboration with the club’s goalkeeping coaches and sports scientists. The overhead lights change from being simply dim to a dark, low-level blue. O’Connor watches from the side of the chamber, while Jack Woodburn, the company’s head of sports science, controls the lighting and ball-release mechanisms from a laptop on the other side of the wall. I’m working at a specifically chosen frequency of light that forces a 10 percent delay in the processing speed between the eye and the brain. Okkulo can switch between different light modes that have varying effects on the brain’s processing of visual information. Low blue light is used to test visual focus and anticipation; green light is cruelly designed to challenge our peripheral vision and powers of identification. Switching to dim red light alters powers of depth perception. The final, boss-level light mode combines aspects of all three settings for a 23 percent reduction in eye, brain, and muscle coordination. It feels almost psychedelic. Another ball fires out under Okkulo’s blue lights, and I feel as though my body belongs to someone else, as though the ball has found a second wind halfway through its flight path and is accelerating past the point where it would naturally begin to slow. I seem to have accidentally consumed three beers, three chasers, and a tequila slammer. Next, O’Connor and I toss a tennis ball back and forth. The best way to describe the sensation is to try and recall the first time you wore 3D glasses at the cinema—both familiar and unerring at once. Five more soccer balls are fired my way. I’m warming up, I think, until O’Connor switches Okkulo to its green light setting and bounces a tennis ball gently off the wall towards me. I’m left hopelessly grasping at air. I never claimed to be much of a soccer player, but it is a different feeling entirely to find yourself suddenly unable to play catch. But give it enough time, and the brain begins to adapt. Twenty-two professional soccer players at Sunderland AFC—another big club with a storied history, currently playing in the second tier of English soccer—recently took part in a six-week study of Okkulo. First, the players had their visual-motor skills assessed with software. Onscreen tests measured how well they could focus on small moving objects, their reaction times, and their peripheral vision. The software also assessed how well they could anticipate the movement of an object, and how much time they needed to recognize a target object surrounded by other distracting stimuli. Then they were split into two equal groups and completed training drills twice a week under the supervision of an Okkulo coach—one group using Okkulo’s lighting system, and the other under normal conditions. Outside these sessions, both groups trained as normal. Then, after six weeks, they had their visual-motor skills reassessed using the software. Compared to the control group, on average players using the Okkulo system found that their recognition time was enhanced by almost 60 percent, allowing them to identify relevant activity faster among crowded fields. Furthermore, their identification of stimuli in their peripheral vision was 10 percent more accurate and 20 percent quicker, their depth perception 45 percent more accurate, and their sensory reaction time up by 17 percent. The overall result for those in the study, the company claims, is a 36.3 percent improvement in motor reaction time—meaning the players appeared both quicker and more effective in responding to stimuli. When reassessed with the software, they were 17 percent faster instoppingone action, then 36.3 percent faster inbeginningthe next. Should this improvement be replicable in a real-world, in-game sports scenario, it could represent a holy grail in improving sporting performance. O’Connor began to dream up Okkulo more than 20 years ago while working on a film set as a costume designer, having become fascinated by how the cameras reacted to different types of light. He contacted a scientist who’d written a paper on seeing movement in the dark—and who, by pure chance, lived only 20 minutes down the road—and by the end of the afternoon the pair were scheming on how this might relate to sports training, over a cup of tea. Within four weeks they were given a £20,000 research grant from the University of Durham and started work on a rudimentary predecessor of Okkulo, which they tested out with the university's cricket team. This initial research elicited encouraging results. Cricketers subjected to lower light levels in training saw greater improvement in their batting skills than those in the equivalent control group. Later case studies, including aremarkable improvement in match day performance for a goalkeeper in the English Football League, indicated similar improvements—but up until the release of this latest study, O’Connor had been unable to objectively explain how his technology seemed to be bettering athletic performance. “We could see that we were improving athletes, but we needed to find out exactly why [the technology] was doing that. Now we’ve got it in data.” Alex Cairns, a vastly experienced goalkeeper at Leeds United with more than 300 appearances in the English Football League, describes working with Okkulu as a “shock to the system.” For his goalkeeper teammate Harry Christy, 10 years younger and at the other end of his career, time spent training in the chamber was an opportunity to be grabbed with both hands: “I’m looking for every little gain I can get, every edge I can have over every other goalkeeper in the country,” Christy says. Neither goalkeeper was involved in the study at Sunderland AFC. “What’s interesting is that they haven’t just changed the light levels, they’ve changed the specific quality and waves of that light,” says Niall Macfarlane, a professor in physiology and sports science at the University of Glasgow who wasn’t involved in the research. Experimenting with different types of low light—blue, red, green—has far more scope for generating improvements than just using dimmed light on its own, he believes. Macfarlane does, however, harbor some reservations about how smoothly the research’s positive results would be translated into improvements in performance in a real-life soccer match. “I think it is far better suited to something like baseball or cricket where you can replicate the game scenario more closely,” he says. Unlike in the highly variable environment of a soccer game, with batting sports “you know where the ball is going to come from, you know roughly the speed it’s going to come at, so [through the training] you can refine the tracking of that ball and the consistency of the contact.” It is little surprise then that when I arrived earlier this afternoon, O’Connor was in the process of booking flights to Arizona. He is currently in contact with more than half of the teams in Major League Baseball. But there’s still more work to do. Further research is needed to see how long the benefits of the light training last, as well as to confirm that there was no performance bias at work in the recent study—it was obvious to the participants which group was receiving the Okkulo intervention and which was not, which may have subconsciously influenced the participants’ performance in testing. Future tests could account for this by involving some lighting adjustment for the control group as well, to avoid indicating to the participants which group they are in. Outside of elite sports, Okkulo is in the early stages of collaborating with several universities to delve deeper into the potential medical benefits of the technology, leading O’Connor to imagine a future in which hospitals and clinics have ambient light rooms to help patients to recover from severe brain injuries or paralysis. He hopes one day to move Okkulo into the home use and commercial gym sectors, following in the footsteps of companies such as Peloton. But for now, it is my turn. Redemption awaits. The room returns to normal light levels. I stand on my mark and wait to receive the ball. My systems are finely tuned, my heart rate is slightly raised, and my senses are on high alert. It’s time for me to flourish. Clunk—pause—whoosh! I control the ball. It’s perfect. Deft and soundless, falling under my spell like a lost duckling returning gratefully to the embrace of its nest. It belongs here. I experience a few seconds of immense pride before O’Connor reveals that we’ve been working with a ball-speed setting recommended for 10-year-olds. The technology may be exemplary, but even science cannot perform miracles.

Title: Computer Programmer Named ‘Person of Interest’ in Killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO
URL: https://gizmodo.com/computer-programmer-named-person-of-interest-in-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-2000536144
Image URL: https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/12/luigi-mangione-fbi-wanted-unitedhealth.jpg
Content: A 26-year-old man identified as Luigi Mangione arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania has been identified as the person of interest in theDec. 4killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to theNew York Times. Mangione was arrested with what police have described as a handwritten “manifesto,” according to the Times, as well as a firearm described as a ghost gun, a weapon assembled from parts either purchased individually or sometimes 3D printed. Mangione was arrested, roughly 400 miles west of New York City, on firearms charges but has not been charged with the death of Thompson, according to the Times. He appeared for a preliminary arraignment in a Blair County, Pennsylvania, court at 6 p.m. ET. and has been charged with five crimes in the state, including “carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing instruments of crime,” according to theTimes. Mangione was sitting at McDonald’s with a laptop wearing a blue medical mask, according to the criminal complaint obtained byKDKA-TVin Pittsburgh. The cops on the scene approached and asked Mangione if he’d recently been to New York and he “became quiet and started to shake,” according to the complaint. Mangione was reportedly carrying “multiple” fake IDs, including one with the name Mark Rosario which has an address in Maplewood, an affluent suburb of Newark, New Jersey. The same name and address were allegedly used at the hostel where the shooter stayed in New York. BREAKING: Shooting suspect Luigi Mangione seen for the first time since being arrested in PA. Police led him into court.#fox10phoenixpic.twitter.com/zLCuSO53hR — Habib Obi (@ObiSun)December 9, 2024  CNN quoted an unnamed police official who saw the alleged manifesto, which included lines like “These parasites had it coming.” Another line published by CNNreads, “I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done.” The accuracy of those quotes could not be independently verified by Gizmodo. The New York Times reports Mangione was the valedictorian at Gilman School, a private all-boys high school in Baltimore. The internet was also quick to dive into Mangione’s digital footprint, which presents a mix of political ideas that perhaps defy conventional left-right divides. Mangione’s X account lists him as studying“Computer Science @ Penn” and his LinkedIn lists his location asHonolulu, Hawaii. The University of Pennsylvania confirmed to the Times that Mangione graduated in 2020 with a bachelor’s and master’s degree in engineering. A photo obtained by WNBCshows the gunallegedly used to carrying out the killing, which could be part of a 3D printed parts kit. Initial reports indicate that the firearm used in the brazen murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was assembled from a 3D-printed parts kit completion, specifically the Chairmanwon V1 model. This model is a 3D-printed frame designed to accommodate Glock components. [image or embed] — Dr Yannick Veilleux-Lepage (@yveilleuxlepage.bsky.social)December 9, 2024 at 12:51 PM  The complaint goes into more detail about the weapon thatwas found: During a search of the Defendant’s backpack, Officers located a black 3D-printed pistol and a black silencer. The pistol had a metal slide and a plastic handle with a metal threaded barrel. The pistol had one loaded Glock magazine with six nine-millimeter full metal jacket rounds. There was also one loose nine-millimeter hollow point round. The silencer was also 3D printed. Mangione’s LinkedIn also lists him as being a data engineer at TrueCar Inc. in Santa Monica since 2020, which the company confirmed to the New York Times, though said he last worked there in 2023. His LinkedIn also lists previous work as a teaching assistant in artificial intelligence at Stanford in the summer of 2019 and an internship at Firaxis Games in 2016 and 2017. Reporter Jacob Silverman pointed out on X thatMangione’s banner imageon that social media platform appears to show an X-ray. The obvious implication is that Mangione may have experienced health issues in some way that may point to some kind of motivation for a crime against a healthcare CEO. I'm guessing this middle photo in Luigi Mangione's X banner has some bearing on the situation herepic.twitter.com/BltTPY7BJS — Jacob Silverman (@SilvermanJacob)December 9, 2024  Barstool reporter Jack Mac tweeted about having an unnamed source who told him that Mangione injured his back surfing but the surgery “didn’t go great,” claims Gizmodo could not independently verify. Mac also said his back surgery “changed everything and he went “absolutely crazy.” Spoke with a source that had a lot of friends that went to high school with Luigi Mangione. What keeps coming up is a back surgery that “changed everything” for him and he went “absolutely crazy.” Checks out with his GoodReads history and the X-Ray in his header.pic.twitter.com/dsrXMQcqB2 — Jack Mac (@JackMacCFB)December 9, 2024  The reviews on what appear to be Mangione’s account onGoodreadsinclude everything from the Unabomber’s manifestoIndustrial Society and Its Future(which he gives 4/5 stars) to Dr. Seuss’sThe Lorax(which he gives 5/5 stars). Assuming it’s the same Mangione—and it does look like the photo in the profile is similar to one of the images released by police—the 26-year-old seems to have also reviewed books likeBrave New Worldby Aldous Huxley and the 2015 biography of Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance. From Mangione’s review of Ted Kaczinski’s book: Clearly written by a mathematics prodigy. Reads like a series of lemmas on the question of 21st century quality of life. It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out. He was a violent individual – rightfully imprisoned – who maimed innocent people. While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary. People obviously found his review interesting given the fact that he is a person of interest in a homicide investigation with potential political motives. “Reviewing the unabomber’s manifesto on goodreads and giving it a 4/5 is so fucking funny man,” one online humorist known as Ceej wrote onBluesky. reviewing the unabomber’s manifesto on goodreads and giving it a 4/5 is so fucking funny man — ceej (@ceej.online)December 9, 2024 at 10:50 AM  Magione tweeted about a number of topics, including his belief that porn should be regulated, in a post fromearlier this year. Porn should be regulated no less than alcohol, cigarettes, and travel — Luigi Mangione (@PepMangione)January 24, 2024  Social media also quickly filled up with jokes about Mangione’s identification at a McDonald’s, including jokes about the elderly customer who apparently called police after he spotted someone who looked like the security camera images that had been released by law enforcement. Some joked about giving the McDonald’s where Mangione was arrested abad review on Yelp. The New York Times reports Mangione was a member of the Hub Coworking Hawaii coworking space in Honolulu. He reportedly would come in with others from Surfbreak a coliving space for “digital nomads”—people whose jobs allow them to work remotely from places like Hawaii. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro gave a press conference Monday evening about the case and admonished anyone who may be celebrating the killing of a health insurance CEO. “In some dark corners, he’s being hailed as a hero. Hear me on this, he is no hero. The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald’s this morning,” Shapirosaid. The gap between the way that mainstream TV news has talked about the killing and the way it’s being discussed online has been astonishing. There’s clearly an anger in the U.S. about the way that health care is administered and some celebrated the death of the CEO, or at least expressed ambivalence. UnitedHealth Group’s Facebook post about the death of Thompson was met with over 90,000 laughing emojis before that feature was disabled. Some people have made videos on platforms like TikTok and Instagram praising the killer, and there are evenfan-editsattacking the health insurance CEO and politicians. THEY ARE MAKING FAN EDITS ON TIKTOKpic.twitter.com/vZlIt8TUDn — tooth 🔆🇵🇸🇮🇪 (@toothbrushlord)December 7, 2024  Now that we may have a name for a person who could be connected to the case, it will be interesting to see how the conversation changes online. Because that can change dramatically when a mysterious figure known only as a mythologized outlaw becomes a real person with a history and opinions that may differ from preconceived notions about his motivation.

Title: Of Course Dan Da Dan Is Coming Back for Season 2
URL: https://gizmodo.com/of-course-dan-da-dan-is-coming-back-for-season-2-2000540902
Image URL: https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/12/Dan-Da-Dan-Okarun-Momo-Seiko-Ayase-Turbo-Granny-Anime-Science-Saru.jpg
Content: To mark the end ofDan Da Dan‘sfirst season, Science Saru announced we won’t have to sit on our hands and wait long to know whether or not the show has any shot at a second season, because the anime has been renewed. What’s more, fans will only have to wait seven months to pick up on the show’s cliffhanger becauseDan Da Danwill make its grand return in July 2025. The news, which leaked ahead of the premiere of the show’s 12th episode on X/Twitter, was then made official on theofficialDan Da Dansocial media account. Coupled with the announcement was a poster teasing the events that lie in store for Okarun and Momo Ayase in the show’s second season. Key among the notable figures in the season two poster were images of Jiji Enjoji with Evil Eye looming over his shoulders; floating portraits of famous composers like Beethoven, Bach, and Franz Schubert (don’t ask); and a glimpse of upcoming cast member, Vamola, in her titular Godzilla spacesuit (also don’t ask). Season 1 is a wrap, but the wild ride isn’t anywhere near over. 💥#DANDADANSeason 2 airs July 2025!pic.twitter.com/uxaPsKMXwa — DAN DA DAN Anime EN (@animeDANDADANen)December 19, 2024  Given all of the above information and the first season ending roughly on the manga’s 33rd chapter (with some spillover with later chapters to round the season out), it’s safe to wager thatDan Da Dan‘s second season will adapt the manga up until its 73rd chapter. Should that be the case, the anime’s second season may halt at yet another cliffhanger leading to the manga’s kaiju arc. Dan Da Dangetting renewed for a second season is not only a triumph specifically for Netflix as it bolsters its anime catalogue with shows likeBeastars,Ranma 1/2,andBlue Box, and upcoming shows likeSakamoto DaysandCastlevania: Nocturneseason two, it also marks the first time animation studio Science Saru has made a second season of anything. Up until this point, the animation studio has only produced one-and-done seasons of anime with titles likeDevilman: Crybaby,Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, andKeep Your Hands Off Eizouken. Outside ofDan Da Dan, Science Saru has a busy schedule on its horizon, animating shows like the newGhost in the Shellseries in 2026 as well asBeastarcreator Paru Itagaki’sSandamanga. In io9’s review ofDan Da Dan‘s first season we heralded Science Saru’s show as the quintessential anime adaptation of 2024, writing, “Dan Da Dansets the stage for a potential paradigm shift in the shonen genre, demonstrating the lengths to which creatives can push the boundaries without resorting to well-trodden stereotypes.” All episodes ofDan Da Danseason one are streaming on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu.

Title: Life Extension Could Be a Threat to Human Existence
URL: https://gizmodo.com/life-extension-could-be-a-threat-to-human-existence-2000529903
Image URL: https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/11/A-laboratory-worker.jpg
Content: A growing area of investment by the world’s richest people is life extension, the emergent techno-scientific field that seeks to expand human life spans, reduce aging, and (in the mind of some overly ambitious hopefuls)cheat death itself. The gist is this: rich people want to live forever, and they’re willing to spend the GDP of a small nation to achieve it. The New York Postrecently intervieweda corporate executive who said he feared that the development of such technologies would lead to the rise of a race of “posh, privileged zombies.” Phil Cleary, the founder of the SmartWater Group, a forensics contractor, told the newspaper: “At the rate technology is evolving, it will only be a matter of time before life-extending drugs become freely available to those who can afford them.” Apparently taking it upon himself to say what the rest of us watching this hubristic spectacle have been thinking all along, Cleary went full rampage mode against the band of plutocrats: “Silicon Valley’s dogged pursuit of the fountain of youth is a fear-led, ego-driven folly that comes at a terrible humanitarian cost to the planet and to its most vulnerable inhabitants,” he said. Cleary, who aptly told the newspaper that tech billionaires could better serve humanity by donating to communities that need it, further predicted that life extension technologies would ultimately go to the most privileged: “A pill that keeps people alive, even by a few decades, would create an unjust, inequitable world packed with posh, privileged zombies—predominately white, middle-class folk who could afford to buy the drugs in the first place,” Cleary said. “The billionaires behind this dangerous research should therefore quit playing God and reevaluate what ‘life’ really means.” “Keeping children alive until at least their 18th birthday is unquestionably more important to humanity than extending the run of those privileged few who have already had the chance to see the world, to have children of their own, and to realize their own special ambitions,” Cleary added. It’s unclear if the life-extension field can really deliver on its promises, however. If there’s one person who has served as the poster boy for this movement, it’s Bryan Johnson, the 47-year-old venture capitalist who, through the apparent miracles of de-aging technology, went from a normal-looking middle-aged guy to an entity that self-admittedlyresembles a vampire. Last time we checked, Johnson had begun selling a line of supplements, dubbed Blueprint, as well as a “Longevity Mix,” designed to keep you young. Johnson also recently injectedsomeone else’s fat into his faceas part of a “bio-hack,” had an allergic reaction, and suffered a (presumably temporary) ballooning of his facial features. In short: if this is what improved longevity looks like, it’s weird that it looks so unhealthy. Many other tech entrepreneurs and billionaires are obviously obsessed with de-aging and eternal life, albeit in a much less personalized way than Johnson. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is said to haveinvested $180 millioninto a startup dubbed Retro Biosciences, the likes of which wants to add ten years to the human lifespan. Meanwhile, tech magnates like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel have alsodumped large truckloads of cashinto similar pursuits. Thiel, who has reportedly saidhe hopes to live to 120, is said to have provided funding to a non-profit known as the Methuselah Foundation, which aims to make “90 the new 50 by 2030.” Bezos is said to have investedsome $3 billioninto a biotechnology company, Altos Labs, thatseeks to reduce and even reversethe natural aging process. Look, living a long time and being healthy sounds really great, and if these technologies can effectively do that, and then be distributed in an equitable, affordable fashion amongst the global population, that would be amazing. That said, history tells us that when advances in health and technology do come along, the benefits of those innovations generally go to the most privileged. The U.S. doesn’t even have socialized medicine yet and, under the incoming Trump administration, Americans’ access to healthcareseems destined for challenges. It’s difficult to imagine that live-forever-pills wouldn’t be prohibitively expensive to most of us. If these billionaires’ wildest dreams are realized, it portends the rise of a permanent ruling class.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Antarcticais Earth's frozen continent. Covering 5.5 million square miles (14.2 million square kilometers), it's bigger than Europe and Australia. It holds about 60% of Earth's total fresh water, with iceup to 3 miles (5 kilometers) thickin places. But this wasn't always the case. During theCretaceous period(145 million to 66 million years ago), when dinosaurs roamed Earth,Antarctica was ice-free and was covered in a subtropical rainforest, serving as a land bridge for theseextinct giants to cross continents. Around 34 million years ago, things changed andan ice sheet started growing across the landscape. Global temperatures plummeted and the continents shifted, separating Antarctica from South America and creating a circumpolar current that isolated it from the rest of the world. Now, just a tiny fraction of Antarctica is covered with vegetation — but that's starting to change, as warmer global temperatures melt the ice,turning the landscape green.

Title: Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder: Cold case review team hopeful forensics help will solve mystery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2024/12/23/sophie-toscan-du-plantier-murder-cold-case-review-team-hopeful-forensics-help-will-solve-mystery/

Content: Gardaícarrying out a cold-case review of the investigation into the murder of French film producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in west Cork 28 years ago remain hopeful of finding forensic evidence which will enable them to identify her killer. The Garda serious crime review team under Det Supt Des McTiernan in Dublin and Det Supt Joe Moore in west Cork has spent the past 30 months examining the original investigation and subsequent reviews, leading to it checking more than 1,600 witness statements. The team has also been liaising closely withForensic Science Ireland(FSI) regarding the latest advances in forensic DNA science with a view to using the most advanced DNA testing to try to identify Ms Toscan du Plantier’s killer from samples taken in the original investigation. A mother of one from Paris, Ms Toscan du Plantier (39) was battered to death and her badly beaten body was found by a gate at the entrance to her isolated holiday home at Dreenane in Toormore outside Schull on the morning of December 23rd, 1996. Garda technical experts collected items from the scene including a bloodstained rock and a breeze block used in the murder as well as blood samples from a gate and a door frame, while samples were also taken from Ms Toscan du Plantier’s body and clothing at postmortem. Gardaí identified a suspect in the case, English journalistIan Baileyand he was subsequently arrested in February 1997 and although he was released and never charged in connection with the case, gardaí seized Mr Bailey’s clothing, which was also forensically examined. [Toscan du Plantier murder was ‘very solvable’ case but for Garda errorsOpens in new window] According to a source close to the cold-case review, gardaí remain hopeful that with advances in forensic DNA testing techniques, these samples taken at both at the scene and at postmortem, which have all been properly retained, will help identify Ms Toscan du Plantier’s killer. “With advances in DNA technology, scientists don’t need as large a sample to get a match – for example, low copy number DNA, which was used in the recent Nora Sheehan murder case in west Cork 40 years ago, was a huge advance but that’s almost obsolete now with new technologies.” According to the source, forensics is particularly important in the Toscan du Plantier murder investigation because of the history of the case where a number of key witnesses retracted statements, claiming they had made them under duress from gardaí. Mr Bailey’s partner, Jules Thomas, told gardaí following her arrest in 1997 said she was sure Mr Bailey had got up in the early hours of December 23rd at their home at the Prairie, Liscaha, Schull, but she later withdrew the statement and said it was not an accurate account of her Garda interview. Another witness in the case, Marie Farrell, initially told gardaí that she saw a man, whom she later identified as Ian Bailey, at Kealfadda bridge near Ms Toscan du Plantier’s home on the night of the murder but she also retracted the statement and said gardaí had coerced her into making it. “Given the history of this investigation with people making statements and then withdrawing them, forensics provide the best independent objective evidence to present to the DPP in the file that the cold-case team will send,” said the source. According to the source, the serious crime review team believes from its discussions with FSI that the State agency is willing to send the samples to wherever the most advanced testing technologies have been developed, in the hope of getting a match. [Sophie Toscan du Plantier case: Failure to deliver justice ‘a deep shame,’ says Micheál MartinOpens in new window] Meanwhile a team of seven detectives operating out of Bantry Garda station has so far interviewed more than 300 witnesses as they re-examine original statements and in some cases this has led it to identifying new witnesses whom it has also interviewed. “The team have literally gone to the four corners of the world – they have obviously taken statements in west Cork and in Ireland and in Europe but also in North America, Central America and South America as well as in Australia,” said the source. “They are planning to travel to France to take statements from a number of people there but some French witnesses such as Sophie’s friends Agnes Thomas and Frederique More came to Bantry earlier this month to make statements to the team.” Ian Bailey, who died on January 21st last at the age of 66, was twice arrested but never charged with the murder and he repeatedly denied any involvement in the killing. He was convicted in absentia in Paris in 2019 but the High Court ruled he could not be extradited to France. Barry Roche is Southern Correspondent of The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Whales Can Live Up to Twice as Long as We Thought, Scientists Say
URL: https://www.sciencealert.com/whales-can-live-up-to-twice-as-long-as-we-thought-scientists-say
Image URL: https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/WhaleInShallowWater.jpg
Content: Southern right whaleshave lifespans that reach well past 100 years, and 10% may live past 130 years, according to our new research publishedin the journalScience Advances. Some of these whales may live to 150. This lifespan is almost double the 70-80 years they are conventionally believed to live. North Atlantic right whaleswere also thought to have a maximum lifespan ofabout 70 years. We found, however, that thiscritically endangeredspecies' current average lifespan is only 22 years, and they rarely live past 50. These two species are very closely related – only 25 years ago they were considered to be one species – so we'd expect them to have similarly long lifespans. We attribute the stark difference in longevity in North Atlantic right whales to human-caused mortality, mostly from entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. We made these new age estimatesusing photo identification of individual female whales over several decades. Individual whales can be recognized year after year from photographs. When they die, they stop being photographically "resighted" and disappear. Using these photos, we developed what scientists call "survivorship curves" by estimating the probability whales would disappear from the photographic record as they aged. From these survivorship curves, we could estimate maximum potential lifespans. Twenty-five years ago, scientists working with Indigenous whale hunters in the Arctic showed that bowhead whales could live up to andeven over 200 years. Their evidence included finding stone harpoon points that hadn't been used since the mid-1800s embedded in the blubber of whales recently killed by traditional whalers. Analysis of proteins from the eyes of hunted whales provided further evidence of their long lifespan. Like right whales, before that analysis, researchers thought bowhead whales lived to about 80 years, and that humans were the mammals that lived the longest. In the years following that report, scientists tried to figure out what was unique about bowhead whales that allowed them to live so long. But our new analysis of the longevity of two close relatives of bowheads shows that other whale species also have potentially extremely long lives. Understanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them. Animals that have very long lifespansusually reproduce extremely slowlyand can go many years between births. Baleen whales' life history – particularly the age when females start breeding and the interval between calves – is strongly influenced by their potential lifespan. Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption. There are many other large whales, including blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. Like bowhead and right whales, these were alsoalmost wiped out by whaling. Scientists currently assume they live about 80 or 90 years, but that's what we believed about bowhead and right whales until data proved they can live much longer. How long can these other whale species live? Industrial whaling, which ended only in the 1960s, removed old whales from the world's whale populations. Though many whale populations are recovering in number, there hasn't been enough time for whales born after the end of industrial whaling to become old. It's possible, even likely, that many other whale species will also prove to have long lifespans. Other research finds theloss of older individualsfrom populations is a phenomenon occurring across most large animal species. It diminishes the reproductive potential of many species. Researchers also argue this represents a real loss of culture and wisdom in animals that degrades their potential for survival in the face of changing conditions. We want to better understand how whaling affected the number of old individuals in current whale populations and predict when the number of old individuals will recover to prewhaling levels. Preliminary results suggest it may be another 100 years before whale populations truly recover, even for species whose populations now number as many as there were before whaling. For North Atlantic right whales, our research shows that even when the population was increasing, the management actions taken were insufficient to prevent these whales from dying far too young.

Title: «Boréaliser»: un pont forestier entre l’art et la science
URL: https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/826885/borealiser-pont-forestier-entre-art-science
Image URL: https://media1.ledevoir.com/image/826885.jpg?ts=1734930274
Content: Il y a quelques semaines, en lieu et place du numéro 64 de la revueZinc, paraissaitBoréaliser, un ouvrage collectif d’une centaine de pages que ses codirecteurs et codirectrices Jonathan Hope, Cassie Bérard, Catherine Cyr et Miguel Montoro Girona définissent comme « un projet interdisciplinaire réunissant des littéraires et des écologistes afin de construire un pont entre l’art et la science ». Une phrase de la romancière Catherine Leroux, citée dans le livre, aurait pu servir de sous-titre : « La forêt, c’est là où habite la littérature. » Jonathan Hope, professeur au Département d’études littéraires de l’UQAM, explique que le recueil est le fruit d’un travail entrepris en 2021. « Avec plusieurs partenaires, à commencer par le Groupe de recherche en écologie de la MRC Abitibi de l’Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue, nous avons ouvert un chantier de création et de réflexion intituléRéécrire la forêt boréale. L’objectif était de réunir autour de cette forêt, qui est à la fois immense et fragile, deux cohortes de chercheurs et de créateurs. Nous désirions procéder de manière pratique, concrète, à une co-construction du savoir. » Les organisateurs ont alors émis le postulat qu’il y aurait, dans tous les textes générés par la recherche scientifique sur le terrain ou en laboratoire, qu’il s’agisse d’articles, de rapports, de protocoles, de courriels ou de demandes de subvention, un potentiel littéraire à développer. « Nous voulions inciter les scientifiques à assumer pleinement le geste d’écrire, explique Hope. Mais aussi pousser les littéraires à explorer l’univers des sciences de la forêt et les imaginaires de l’écologie, les enjoindre à plonger avec leurs outils dans les enjeux, notamment environnementaux, qui concernent la forêt boréale. Nous souhaitions, en somme, valoriser les savoir-faire des uns et des autres, expérimenter ensemble à partir de tout ça. » À une époque où la pensée en vase clos se généralise, les universitaires ont osé opter pour le croisement, la rencontre improbable et la dépolarisation en organisant à Rouyn-Noranda, à Amos et à Montréal des ateliers, des discussions, des tables rondes et des lectures publiques. De ces excursions réelles et imaginaires en forêt ont émergé les neuf textes fort contrastés qui se sont taillé une place jusqu’au livre. D’abord accompagné par Marie Noëlle Blais, des Éditions du Quartz, une maison qui publie et diffuse des œuvres enracinées dans le territoire boréal, le projet a finalement été mené à bien grâce à Mélanie Vincelette, de la revue montréalaiseZinc. Catherine Cyr, professeure au Département d’études littéraires de l’UQAM, tient à préciser que l’objectif des textes retenus n’est absolument pas de vulgariser la science. « C’est une véritable réécriture de la matière scientifique, explique-t-elle. La perspective littéraire permet de mobiliser une sensibilité aussi bien que des préoccupations formelles. Loin du discours universitaire, ou de ce qu’on pourrait considérer comme tel, l’écriture apparaît ici dans ce qu’elle peut avoir de plus libre, de plus créatif. » En effet, qu’ils s’intéressent aux champignons, aux castors ou aux papillons, qu’ils s’interrogent sur les coupes, les incendies ou les épidémies d’insectes, Brigitte Léveillé, Erika Leblanc-Belval, David Paquette-Bélanger, Jonathan Cazabonne, Alexandre Côté-Perras et Simon Dansereau-Laberge ne se sont pas gênés pour entrelacer humour et gravité, création et théorie, poésie et données, témoignages et plaidoyers en faisant constamment dialoguer des œuvres artistiques et scientifiques de toutes sortes. À partir des faits, leurs prises de parole s’autorisent la subjectivité, l’imagination et la métaphore. Le texte théâtral de Pierre-Olivier Gaumond aborde la question de l’efficacité contestée des bandes riveraines, une stratégie qui permettrait, selon certains, de filtrer la pollution, de contrer l’érosion et d’améliorer la qualité de l’eau. « J’ai inventé un personnage de chercheur slovaque qui présente une conférence lors d’un colloque, explique l’étudiant au doctorat en études littéraires. C’est ma manière de faire écho aux travaux de Michel Guimond, étudiant à la maîtrise en écologie forestière à l’UQAT, qui signe d’ailleurs lui aussi un texte dans le livre, une enquête dont le héros est un détective écologiste et, le crime, une coupe forestière survenue il y a 15 ou 20 ans. » Les organisateurs nous apprennent que la deuxième édition deRéécrire la forêt boréalese prépare déjà et qu’il est fort probable qu’un ouvrage en découle une fois de plus. « Nous allons poursuivre en nous appuyant sur les mêmes principes, explique Catherine Cyr, mais en nous intéressant cette fois aux eskers, ces constructions qui se sont formées durant le retrait glaciaire. » « Fournissant de l’eau potable à toute la localité, précise Jonathan Hope, les eskers d’Amos sont d’anciens lits de rivières dont le gravier et le sable filtrent l’or bleu. Il y a, autour des eskers, des enjeux très importants, notamment politiques, dont on n’a pas fini d’entendre parler. » Dirigé par Jonathan Hope, Cassie Bérard, Catherine Cyr et Miguel Montoro Girona, Publications Zinc, Montréal, 120 pages.

Content: Every so often, news headlines warn of an outbreak of kennel cough. Pet parents are cautioned to keep their dogs away from dog parks, kennels, or daycares. In extreme cases, animal shelters close, and rescue transports are halted. In July 2024, for example, a severe kennel cough outbreak hit animal shelters in Delaware. Public health officialsissued a temporary, one-month lockdownto stop the spread. The lockdown prevented animal shelters from receiving new animals from out-of-state organizations, adopting animals to non-Delaware families, and transferring animals to partner rescues in other states. State officials acknowledged that the stress on the shelters was “significant.” Outbreaks like the one in Delaware can prompt many pet owners to ask questions such as: What is kennel cough, and how worried should we be about it? Read More:Can Dogs Get Sick? How to Keep Your Dog Healthy Kennel cough,known in themedical community as canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), is a respiratory illness that can be mild for some dogs but fatal for others. Kennel cough is highly contagious and spreads rapidly in places where animals are in close contact with each other. Shelters, kennels, dog parks, and doggy daycares are all places where an animal can catch kennel cough. However, shelters are of particular concern because the animals living there may be stressed or immunocompromised. Kennel cough isn’t caused by just one pathogen. “Several different viruses and bacteria can contribute to CIRDC,” says Sandra Faeh, a veterinarian and president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. These pathogens typically involvethe usual suspects like canine distemper, canine influenza, and canine adenovirus type 2. But in recent years, emerging pathogens like canine pneumovirus and respiratory coronavirus have been associated with kennel cough and have shown what researchers call “remarkable resilience” in their ability to infect. Dogs with CIRDC will develop a cough. “The hallmark sign is a persistent, frequent cough that can sound like a goose honk, retching, or gagging, and may involve froth that looks like vomit,” Faeh says. Other symptoms like sneezing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and runny eyes or nose are indicators the dog needs to see the veterinarian as soon as possible. “Early medical attention can often prevent complications and promote a quicker recovery,” Faeh says. Healthy adult dogs might not become seriously ill if they come in contact with the CIRDC pathogens. However, it can be fatal for puppies, senior dogs, and dogs with a weak immune system or other underlying health issues. With vulnerable dogs, Faeh says a mild infection can advance to a more severe illness such as pneumonia. “Pet owners should remain vigilant but not overly alarmed,” Faeh says. A dog’s lifestyle will determine what type of vigilance a pet parent needs to maintain. A dog, for example, who frequents a dog park, will benefit from vaccines that a couch potato may not require. “Vaccination not only lowers the risk of dogs contracting the illness but also reduces the severity of disease and the likelihood of spreading it to other dogs,” Faeh says. “This is why many facilities and events where multiple dogs gather, such as dog shows, training centers, and boarding facilities, require proof of vaccination.” Because more than one pathogen can cause kennel cough, Faeh says pet parents should plan on their dog receiving multiple vaccines, which may include canine distemper, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parvovirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and canine influenza. “Your veterinarian can guide you in determining the most appropriate vaccines and vaccination schedule for your dog based on the animal’s age, lifestyle, exposure risk, and other factors,” she says. In addition to vaccines, there are preventative measures that pet parents can take during known breakouts to limit their dog’s risk. During outbreaks, for example, Faeh says a dog needs to skip out on their playdates at the park or daycare. People should also avoid boarding their dogs until the breakout passes. And when out for walks, people shouldn’t allow their dogs to come nose-to-nose with unknown dogs. They also shouldn’t be allowed to touch random toys or drink from communal water bowls. If a person suspects their dog has kennel cough, they should take it seriously, even if their dog seems fine. “Remember, dogs can be contagious and still look perfectly healthy,” Faeh says.

Content: U.S. stock futures advanced on Monday following a tumultuous week which included the Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate cut on Wednesday and a “Triple Witching” hour session on Friday. Two out of the four major index futures were trading higher in premarket trade. The 10-year and two-year Treasury yields stood at 4.53% and 4.32%, respectively. The probability of having no change in the interest rates for the upcoming Jan. 31, 2025 decision was at 91.4%, accordingtoCME Group’s FedWatch Tool. Trading schedules will be adjusted for the Christmas holiday week. All markets will be closed on Wednesday. Trading hours will be shortened on Christmas Eve. In premarket trading on Monday, theSPDR S&P 500 ETF TrustSPYwas up 0.09% to $591.73 and theInvesco QQQ Trust ETFQQQrose 0.23% to $519.04, according toBenzinga Prodata. Cues From The Last Session Risk appetite returned to Wall Street onFriday, giving investors some relief. November’s inflation data came in softer than expected, offering a glimmer of hope that the Federal Reserve may ease its aggressive monetary tightening. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.4% year-over-year, below the anticipated 2.5%. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also undershot expectations, climbing 2.8% instead of the projected 2.9%. This unexpected cooling of inflation sparked a jubilant rally across all major indices. The S&P 500 surged 1.09%, with every sector contributing to the gains. Investors cheered the reprieve from persistent inflationary pressures. The real estate sector led the charge, experiencing a sharp rebound after being particularly hard-hit by the Fed’s recent hawkish stance. Small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2000, also posted strong gains of 0.94%, buoyed by a significant recovery in regional banks. Insights From Analysts The number of advancers surpassed the decliners among the S&P 500 index constituents on Friday after a 14-day streak of negative market breadth.Ryan Detrick, the global market strategist at Carson Research highlighted how the markets have performed after previous long streaks ended. Record 14 days in a row of more declining stocks than advancing stocks for the S&P 500 ended on Friday.Here's what happened after previous long streaks ended. 💪pic.twitter.com/WV6PU7juQF According to the data shared by him, over the past four decades, there have been only five other instances where the S&P 500 experienced a period of ten or more consecutive days of negative breadth. Additionally, the index was higher by an average of 17.9% a year later after all five times. Going back 40 years, there have been five other times the S&P 500 had more decliners than advancers for 10 consecutive days or more.A year later? Higher all five times and up 17.9% on avg.pic.twitter.com/eYCUpiz4PU Along with this, the market breadth turned positive with 89% of the stocks rising on Friday as compared to only 4% on Wednesday. This divergence also led the index to be higher a year later by at least 92.3% of the time since 1985. Less than 4% advancers on the S&P 500 on Wednesday, but 89% on Friday.Previous times saw a flush and then major buying two days later?Negative 1 and 3 mos later on avg, but higher a year later 12 out of 13 times (92.3%).pic.twitter.com/yqfV0tBFUV According toGary Alexanderat Navellier & Associates, “The S&P 500 delivers an average of zero gains in the first half of December (and 0.3% through December 15 this year) but averages 1.35% in the second half, the best half-month of the 24 half-months each year.” “Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure, excluding food and energy), the key inflation metric for the Fed, came in at 0.1% for November, below forecast and the lowest since June. This caught the market off guard, in a good way, as the rhetoric from Jerome Powell regarding sticky inflation had led the market to expect a surprise in the other direction,” saidLouis Navellierof Navellier & Associates. “The traditional Santa Rally is the last 5 trading days of the year and the first 2 of the New Year. It may still be in the cards,” he added.

Title: Canadian government funding for AI development to benefit U.S. company, critics note
URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadian-government-funding-for-ai-development-to-benefit-us-company/
Image URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/QGEALOEVBBB2LHQ6VLIHDVYQ4Q.JPG?auth=fe193b7596a81a60049981f464cc90d4c7d2fff3decc9932cf43d7cf3a1d71a9&width=1200&height=800&quality=80&smart=true
Content: According to an Innovation, Science and Economic Development official, the $240-million will be used by Cohere to purchase capacity for its own compute needs at the data centre that CoreWeave will build.DADO RUVIC/Reuters One name was conspicuously absent fromthe federal government’s official announcementof the first investment made through its sovereign artificial-intelligence compute strategy, a $2-billion program to help Canadian companies access and build the infrastructure necessary to train and run AI models and applications. The press release issued earlier this month named only Cohere Inc., a Toronto-based AI company, as the recipient of up to $240-million to help build a multibillion data centre in Canada. The announcement did not mention that CoreWeave Inc., a U.S. company, would be building the data centre and is, in effect, the indirect recipient of the funding. The inclusion of an American company in the very first round of funding from a sovereign program caught some experts and industry players off guard, drawing criticism. “It’s taking Canadian tax dollars and giving it to a foreign entity,” said Adam Hendin, the co-founder and CEO of Radium, an AI data centre company in Toronto. “We want to support Canadian, sovereign companies that are building this technology.” The federal government firstannounced the $2-billion program in Aprilto help companies access the graphics processing units (GPUs) and other infrastructure crucial to powering AI, as well as to encourage companies to build data centres in Canada. Many countries see the acquisition of GPUs and data centres as a matter of economic security, given the intense demand for computer chips and the potential for AI to transform economies. In December, Innovation, Science and Economic Developmentannounced further detailsof the program, including $700-million to build and expand data centres and $300-million to pay for the AI compute costs of small- and medium-sized businesses. The remaining $1-billion will be used to upgrade and build high-performance compute for academic researchers. Just one day after ISED unveiled the details andinvited companies to make applications, then-finance minister Chrystia Freeland announced up to $240-million for Cohere. “The Government of Canada, the people of Canada, together with Cohere, will be investing $240-million to get an AI data centre built,” she said at Cohere’s office in Toronto. She made only a glancing reference to CoreWeave in her remarks. While the government described the $240-million as an “investment” in Cohere, that’s not entirely accurate. According to an ISED official, the money will be used by Cohere to purchase capacity for its own compute needs at the data centre that CoreWeave will build. The official said that the funding, along with an undisclosed commitment from Cohere, helped give CoreWeave the confidence to build a data centre in Canada. Cohere came to the ISED with the proposal, and brought CoreWeave into the process. The department saw it as an opportunity to act quickly, according to the official. The data centre, which is set to come online in 2025, will have capacity for other Canadian companies as well. Another person familiar with the matter said that Cohere ran a competitive process before partnering with CoreWeave. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they are not authorized to speak publicly. “All of the value and wealth effects of the $240-million look to be captured by a U.S. firm but paid for by Canadians,” said Jim Hinton, an intellectual property lawyer and senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. “Simply buying compute capacity doesn’t make Canada richer or better at generating, retaining, and commercializing AI.” Cohere declined to comment, while CoreWeave did not reply to a request for comment. “It does leave out Canadian data centre providers, infrastructure and semi-conductor firms, which is troubling,” said Graham Dobbs, a senior economist with the Dais think tank at Toronto Metropolitan University. CoreWeave stands to benefit in two ways. Not only could Cohere spend up to $240-million for compute at the data centre, Mr. Dobbs said, but Canadian companies that take advantage of the $300-million in subsidies for their own compute costs could then spend it at CoreWeave’s facility. Still, the construction of the data centre does fill a need for Canadian companies. “If access to domestic AI compute for Canadian firms is the goal, it looks promising,” Mr. Dobbs said, adding that CoreWeave is a premium provider of these services. CoreWeave could go public next year at a US$35-billion valuation,Reuters has reported.Cohere, meanwhile, raised US$500-million earlier this year at aUS$5.5-billion valuation.Nvidia Corp., which will supply the GPUs for the data centre, is an investor in both companies. Jonathan Ahdoot, who heads the cloud computing division at Hypertec Group Inc. in Quebec, said that while he was not expecting CoreWeave to be part of the announcement, he is not entirely surprised, given the company has established itself as a leading AI data centre provider. “There’s not a lot of them,” he said. Hypertec, meanwhile, is still an emerging player in AI. “If this was six months later, I think we probably would have gotten that contract,” he said. Hypertec is also in talks with ISED about its own proposals for the compute program. Indeed, the Cohere announcement is only the first such funding arrangement, with more deals potentially forthcoming. “From supporting proposals with participation by Canadian AI infrastructure firms, to ensuring Canadian SMEs and AI champions get affordable access to the resulting compute, public investment will drive real benefits for Canadian innovators,” said Audrey Milette, a spokesperson for Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne. At the very least, the government has made a sizable bet on Cohere as the country’s AI champion. The $240-million for Cohere’s compute costs is almost as much as the $300-million in subsidies available to small- and medium-sized companies under the program. Cohere, founded in 2019, builds large language models that can underlie chatbots and other AI applications, which is very capital intensive. Cohere is up against deep-pocketed competitors as well, including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Meta Platforms Inc.

Content: OpenAICEOSam AltmanexpectsAGI, orartificial general intelligence—AI that outperforms humans at most tasks—around 2027 or 2028. Elon Musk’s prediction is either2025 or 2026, and he hasclaimedthat he was "losing sleep over the threat of AI danger." But predictions of imminent human-level AI have been made for over 50 years, since theearliest daysof AI. Those predictions were wrong—not merely in terms of timing but in a deeper, categorical sense. We now know that the specific approaches to AI that experts had in mind in the past are simply incapable of getting to human-level intelligence. Similarly, as thelimitationsof current AI have become clear, most AI researchers have come around to the view that simply building bigger and more powerful chatbots won’t lead to AGI. Advanced AI is certainly a long-term worry that researchers should study. But AI risks in 2025 will arise from misuse, as they have thus far. This story is from theWIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. These might be unintentional misuses, such as lawyers over-relying on AI. After the release of ChatGPT, for instance, a number of lawyers have been sanctioned for using AI to generate erroneous court briefings, apparently unaware of chatbots’ tendency to make stuff up. InBritish Columbia, lawyer Chong Ke was ordered to pay costs for opposing counsel after she included fictitious AI-generated cases in a legal filing. InNew York, Steven Schwartz and Peter LoDuca were fined $5,000 for providing false citations. InColorado, Zachariah Crabill was suspended for a year for using fictitious court cases generated using ChatGPT and blaming a "legal intern" for the mistakes. The list is growing quickly. Other misuses are intentional. In January 2024, sexually explicitdeepfakes of Taylor Swiftflooded social media platforms. These images were created using Microsoft’s “Designer” AI tool. While the company had guardrails to avoid generating images of real people, misspelling Swift's name was enough to bypass them. Microsoft has sincefixedthis error. But Taylor Swift is the tip of the iceberg, and non-consensual deepfakes are proliferating widely—in part because open-source tools to create deepfakes are available publicly. Ongoing legislation across the world seeks to combat deepfakes in hope of curbing the damage. Whether it is effective remains to be seen. In 2025, it will get even harder to distinguish what’s real from what’s made up. The fidelity of AI-generated audio, text, and images is remarkable, and video will be next. This could lead to the "liar's dividend": those in positions of power repudiating evidence of their misbehavior by claiming that it is fake. In 2023, Teslaarguedthat a 2016 video of Elon Musk could have been a deepfake in response to allegations that the CEO had exaggerated the safety of Tesla autopilot leading to an accident. An Indian politician claimed that audio clips of him acknowledging corruption in his political party were doctored (the audio in at least one of his clips wasverifiedas real by a press outlet). And two defendants in the January 6 riots claimed that videos they appeared in were deepfakes. Both werefound guilty. Meanwhile, companies are exploiting public confusion to sell fundamentally dubious products by labeling them “AI.” This can go badly wrong when such tools are used to classify people and make consequential decisions about them. Hiring company Retorio, for instance,claimsthat its AI predicts candidates' job suitability based on video interviews, but a study found that the system can be tricked simply by the presence of glasses or by replacing a plain background with a bookshelf, showing that it relies on superficial correlations. There are also dozens of applications in health care, education, finance, criminal justice, and insurance where AI is currently being used to deny people important life opportunities. In the Netherlands, the Dutch tax authority used an AI algorithm to identify people who committed child welfare fraud. Itwrongly accusedthousands of parents, often demanding to pay back tens of thousands of euros. In the fallout, the Prime Minister and his entire cabinet resigned. In 2025, we expect AI risks to arise not from AI acting on its own, but because of what people do with it. That includes cases where itseemsto work well and is over-relied upon (lawyers using ChatGPT); when it works well and is misused (non-consensual deepfakes and the liar's dividend); and when it is simply not fit for purpose (denying people their rights). Mitigating these risks is a mammoth task for companies, governments, and society. It will be hard enough without getting distracted by sci-fi worries.

Title: More Humanitarian Organizations Will Harness AI’s Potential

Content: For many of the people served by the humanitarian sector, 2024 has been the worst of times. Themost recent UN estimatesof those forced to flee violence and disaster is a record of 120 million, a figure that has doubled in the past decade. The broader figure of those in humanitarian need, 300 million people, has been swelled by increasingly violent conflict and growing impacts of the climate crisis. Progress in meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals has also been eitherstagnating or decliningin more than half of the fragile countries. A child born in those countries has a tenfold greater chance of being in poverty than one born in a stable state. This story is from theWIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. The unprecedented numbers show the need for a new humanitarian surge: a technological one, harnessing the power of the digital and AI. For years we’ve (rightly) debated the risks and benefits of AI and waited for the promise of “AI for Good” to arrive. In 2025, across the aid, development, and humanitarian sector, that moment may finally be at hand. When properly leveraged, AI can open up new frontiers in humanitarian action—in scale, speed, reach, personalization, and cost savings. My organization,International Rescue Committee(IRC), and our in-house research and innovation lab,Airbel,are exploring applications of AI in our humanitarian programming. We’re seeing solutions emerging in three critical areas—information, education, and climate—each bolstered by promising public-private partnerships and collaboration. For instance, for refugees forced to flee from conflict, the first priority is timely, accurate, and context-specific information about who to trust, and where to find services and safety.The global information project, Signpost,supported by Google.org—Google’s charitable arm—in partnership with IRC, Cisco Foundation, Zendesk, and Tech for Refugees, delivers critical information to millions of displaced people through digital channels and social media, disempowering smugglers who thrive on mis- or disinformation, and saving lives along migration routes. As this work evolves, Signpost is creating an “AI prototyping lab” to de-risk and evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI for the entire humanitarian sector. Humanitarians are also exploring the potential of Generative AI to enhance and personalize education for children affected by crises—of whom there are 224 million worldwide. A huge challenge involves testing and strengthening the potential ofChatGPTin local languages. AI models, for instance, can’t understand African languages.Lelapa AI, an African “AI research and product lab,” is working to change that,developing new languagesto bring AI to Africa, while OpenAIhas begun to offerlow and reduced cost access to ChatGPT for nonprofits. OpenAI is also supporting the development ofAprendIA, a global, AI-driven educational chatbot platform that delivers personalized digital learning experiences at scale via messaging platforms for crisis-affected children, teachers, and parents, all while testing and strengthening the potential of ChatGPT in local languages. Finally, we are seeing the power of artificial intelligence scaled to protect communities facing the harsh impacts of extreme weather. In partnership with NGOs, governments and the UN,Google has launchedan AI-powered “Flood Hub,” which is currently able to forecast flooding in 80 countries. Google.org, together with IRC and the NGOGiveDirectly, is leveraging machine learningin Northeast Nigeria to establish forecasting systems that trigger early warnings and cash transfers ahead of devastating climate hazards. Israeli scholar and historian Yuval Noah Hararidescribed artificial intelligenceas the most dangerous technology we have ever created—and potentially the most beneficial. In 2025, those benefits must accrue to the poorest in the world.

Title: What to Know About Google’s Breakthrough Weather Prediction Model
URL: https://gizmodo.com/what-to-know-about-googles-breakthrough-weather-prediction-model-2000535098
Image URL: https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/12/noaa-tornado-nebraska-storm.jpg
Content: The Sun’ll come out tomorrow, and you no longer have to bet your bottom dollar to be sure of it. Google’s DeepMind teamreleasedits latest weather prediction model this week, which outperforms a leading traditional weather prediction model across the vast majority of tests put before it. The generative AI model is dubbed GenCast, and it is a diffusion model like those undergirding popular AI tools including Midjourney, DALL·E 3, and Stable Diffusion. Based on the team’s tests, GenCast is better at predictingextreme weather, the movement of tropical storms, and the force of wind gusts across Earth’s mighty sweeps of land. The team’s discussion of GenCast’s performance waspublishedthis week inNature. Where GenCast departs from other diffusion models is that it (obviously) is weather-focused, and “adapted to the spherical geometry of the Earth,” as described by a couple of the paper’s co-authors in aDeepMind blog post. Instead of a written prompt such as “paint a picture of a dachshund in the style of Salvador Dalí,” GenCast’s input is the most recent state of the weather, which the model then uses to generate a probability distribution of future weather scenarios. Traditional weather prediction models likeENS, the leading model from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, make their forecasts by solving physics equations. “One limitation of these traditional models is that the equations they solve are only approximations of the atmospheric dynamics,” said Ilan Price, a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and lead author of the team’s latest findings, in an email to Gizmodo. The first seeds of GenCast were planted in 2022, but the model published this week includes architectural changes and an improved diffusion setup that made the model better trained to predict weather on Earth, including extreme weather events, up to 15 days out. “GenCast is not limited to learning dynamics/patterns that are known exactly and can be written down in an equation,” Price added. “Instead it has the opportunity to learn more complex relationships and dynamics directly from the data, and this allows GenCast to outperform traditional models.” Google has been tooling around with weather prediction for a while, and in recent years have made a couple substantive steps towards more precise forecasting using AI methods. Last year, DeepMind scientists—some of whom co-authored the new paper—released GraphCast, a machine learning-based method that outperformed the current medium-range weather prediction models on 90% of the targets used in testing. Just five months ago, a team mostly consisting of DeepMind researcherspublishedNeuralGCM, a hybrid weather prediction model that combined a traditional physics-based weather predictor with machine-learning components. That team found that “end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional [models] and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.” The resolution achieved by GenCast is roughly six times that of NeuralGCM, but that was expected. “NeuralGCM is designed as a general purpose atmospheric model primarily to support climate modelling, whereas the higher resolution of GenCast is often expected for operational medium range forecast models, which is GenCast’s specific target use-case,” Price added. “This is also why we emphasized a wide range of evaluations which are crucial use cases for operational medium range forecasts, like predicting extreme weather.” In the recent work, the team trained GenCast on historical weather data through 2018, and then tested the model’s ability to predict weather patterns in 2019. GenCast outperformed ENS on 97.2% of targets using different weather variables, with varying lead times before the weather event; with lead times greater than 36 hours, GenCast was more accurate than ENS on 99.8% of targets. The team also tested GenCast’s ability to forecast the track of a tropical cyclone—specifically Typhoon Hagibis, the costliest tropical cyclone of 2019, which hit Japan that October. GenCast’s predictions were highly uncertain with seven days of lead time, but became more accurate at shorter lead times. As extreme weathergenerates wetter, heavier rainfall, andhurricanes break recordsfor how quickly they intensify and how early in the season they form, accurate prediction of storm paths will be crucial in mitigating their fiscal and human costs. But that’s not all. In a proof-of-principle experiment described in the research, the DeepMind team found that GenCast was more accurate than ENS in predicting the total wind power generated by groups of over 5,000 wind farms in the Global Power Plant Database. GenCast’s predictions were about 20% better than ENS’ with lead times of two days or less, and retained statistically significant improvements up to a week. In other words, the model does not just have value in mitigating disaster—it could inform where and how we deploy energy infrastructure. “The development of GenCast, a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) model, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of weather forecasting, as highlighted in the recent Google DeepMind paper,” said an ECMWF spokesperson, in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “GenCast is one of the latest machine learning models reviewed in a series of high-profile scientific papers about MLWP coming from around the globe, which highlight the ongoing (r)evolution in weather forecasting.” The ECMWF statement pointed out that the GenCast paper also compared the model’s performance to ENS 11-mile (18-kilometer) resolution. Now five years later, ENS runs at a 5.6-mile (9 km) resolution. “The GenCast paper presents innovative science from a machine learning point of view, but these improvements have got to be tested on how well they perform in extreme weather events to fully appreciate their value,” the statement concluded. What does all of this mean for you, O casual appreciator of climate? Well, the DeepMind team has made the GenCast code open source and the models available for non-commercial use, so you can tool around if you’re curious. The team is also working on releasing an archive of historical and current weather forecasts. “This will enable the wider research and meteorological community to engage with, test, run, and build on our work, accelerating further advances in the field,” Price said. “We have finetuned versions of GenCast to be able to take operational inputs, and so the model could start to be incorporated in operational setting.” There is not yet a timeline on when GenCast and other models will be operational, though the DeepMind blog noted that the models are “starting to power user experiences on Google Search and Maps.” Whether you’re here for the weather or the AI applications, there’s plenty to like about GenCast and the broader suite of DeepMind forecasting models. The accuracy of such tools will be paramount forpredicting extreme weather eventswith enough lead time to protect those in harm’s way, be it fromfloods in Appalachiaortornadoes in Florida. 12/6 3pm: This story has been updated to include comments from ECMWF.

Image URL: https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/Apple-Intelligence-_-iPhone-15-Pro-Max.jpg
Content: A survey by a website that helps you price second-hand tech found that artificial intelligence is hardly a deciding factor when people choose whether to buy a new phone. The survey was conducted bySellCell, a site with a blog covering gadget trends. Its respondents were over 2,000 smartphone users, over half owning an iPhone with an AI-supported model. TheiPhone 15 ProandiPhone 16/iPhone 16 Proare the only Apple phones offering Apple Intelligence right out of the box. The most popular AI features that people clamor for are the ones that help get the job done the fastest. Generative writing tools, notification summaries, and prioritized messages were among the most used abilities on iPhones with Apple Intelligence. The survey also included results from Samsung users, who have been using Galaxy AI since it debuted on theGalaxy S24at the beginning of the year. Samsung users loveCircle to Search, which makes sense since it’s the best thing that has happened to the Android operating system in a long time. They also use thePhoto AssistGalaxy AI-infused editing offered in the Samsung Gallery app. iPhone users show a higher interest in AI-forward interfaces than their Android-using counterparts. Nearly 17% think they’d switch to a Samsung device if Galaxy AI were to improve markedly. Apple Intelligence users are also more likely than Android users to pay for a subscription to use the features. Still, around 90% of users on both platforms explicitly said “hell no” to paying for the privilege to use AI. In general, the smartphone users surveyed here remain unsatisfied by existing AI features—a whopping 73% of Apple Intelligence users would be OK without it for now, and a higher percentage of 87% of Galaxy AI users don’t find it “very valuable.” If these survey results indicate anything, the helpful AI features—things that help with note-taking and retaining mountains of information—are the ones people want more of. People work by managing and exchanging tons of information back and forth. The more artificial intelligence and forced-upon-us algorithms can prove they’ll make our jobs easier to show up for daily, the faster they’ll convince us that the AI revolution is here.

Title: Most people probably won't notice when artificial general intelligence arrives

Content: AI is advancing rapidly, but most people might not immediately notice its impact on their lives. Take OpenAI's latest o1 models, which the company officially released on Thursday as part of itsShipmas campaign. OpenAI says these models are "designed to spend more time thinking before they respond." Some sayo1shows how we might reachartificial general intelligence— a still theoretical form of AI that meets or surpasses human intelligence — without realizing it. "Models like o1 suggest that people won't generally notice AGI-ish systems that are better than humans at most intellectual tasks, but which are not autonomous or self-directed," Wharton professor andAI expert Ethan Mollickwrote in a post on X. "Most folks don't have a lot of tasks that bump up against limits of human intelligence, so won't see it." Artificial general intelligencehas been broadly defined as anything between "god-like intelligence" and a more modest "machine that can do any task better than a human," Mollick wrote in a May post on his Substack, One Useful Thing. He said that humans can better understand whether they're encountering AGI by breaking its development into tiers, in which the ultimate tier, Tier 1, is a machine capable of performing any task better than a human. Tier 2, or "Weak AGI," he wrote, are machines that outperform average human experts at all tasks in specific jobs — though no such systems currently exist. Tier 3, or "Artificial Focused Intelligence," is an AI that outperforms average human experts in specific, intellectually demanding tasks. While Tier 4, "Co-intelligence," is the result of humans and AI working together. Some in the AI industry believe we've already reached AGI, even if we haven't realized it. "In my opinion, we have already achieved AGI and it's even more clear with o1. We have not achieved 'better than any human at any task,' but what we have is 'better than most humans at most tasks,'" Vahid Kazemi, a member of OpenAI's technical staff, wrote in a post on X on Friday. More conservative AI experts say o1 is just a step along the journey to AGI. "The idea somehow which, you know, is popularized by science fiction and Hollywood that, you know, somehow somebody is going to discover the secret, the secret to AGI, or human-level AI, or AMI, whatever you want to call it. And then, you know, turn on a machine, and then we have AGI. That's just not going to happen," Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, said on Lex Fridman's podcast in March. "It's not going to be an event. It's going to be gradual progress." Jump to

Title: How AI tools are offering clarity in B.C.'s condo market

Content: Sign In Register “Back in 2018, I … thought how strange it was that when you bought a used car you got a Carfax report of its history, but when you spent a million dollars on a condo, you got hundreds of pages of noise,” says Thomas Beattie, CEO of Vancouver-based OctoAI Technologies Corp. Two years later, his company launched Eli Report, which has since produced over 25,000 strata document reports for about 7,000 users across North America. Some of this business is generated through partners such as eStrataHub and Strata Press, two centralized repositories of condo documents. OctoAI is among a growing number of B.C. companies offering AI tools to streamline the purchasing process for real estate agents and buyers. They all use some form of AI to produce summaries of strata document bundles in minutes, making them searchable and flagging important clauses for prospective buyers. In some cases, chatbots can answer pointed questions, and special assessments can be forecasted. “One of the big challenges … with artificial intelligence is that when it doesn’t know [something], it’s very happy to make something up. We designed our systems specifically so that wasn’t a possibility,” Beattie said about Eli Report. His tool has a proprietary system that uses extractive intelligence, sorts and categorizes issues and displays a side-by-side viewer, allowing easy reference to source material. This way, users can double-check the AI summaries, which are produced in under 10 minutes. Meanwhile, traditional manual reviews can be time-consuming, expensive and prone to human error, according to Ashkan Tavassoli. The CEO and co-founder of Vancouver-based BLINQ Innovations Inc. sought out to automate these reviews, developing an AI-driven tool he said aims to see “the bigger picture” by moving beyond keyword searches. “What we do is called semantical search, which is very similar to how manual reviews are done,” he said about his company’s StrataReports tool. “You basically read all the documents, understand the building as a whole, and then we write our report.” StrataReports has a chatbot trained on a building’s data to help prospective buyers with any questions they may have, saving time that might otherwise be spent asking questions to Realtors. “That’s kind of our secret sauce,” said Tavassoli. The company has also partnered with Offerland, which provides a service estimating how much property investors can rent out their units for using live, comparable market data. Another local company has recognized the lack of a standard format for strata document packages can be a challenge for real estate agents and buyers. “The human error aspect is that most people are looking in specific places for information,” said Andrew Armstrong, principal and co-founder of Vancouver-based The Real View (formally 1390729 B.C. Ltd.). “If they don’t find it there, they assume it doesn’t exist.” His company uses a technique known as retrieval-augmented generation to analyze strata document packages to produce a comprehensive report on key aspects of a building, ranging from its financial health to its pet policies. Through optical AI, the company can analyze these documents, even if the PDF quality is poor. If a real estate agent or buyer doesn’t find information where they expect to find it in the strata documents, The Real View’s tool examines every page of every document for every answer. Although they are gaining in popularity, some services may not be fully prepared for the possibility of erroneous or incomplete AI summaries, which can create legal risk. It’s why Eli Report, for example, carries errors-and-omissions (E&O) insurance, and has terms and conditions indemnifying the company against liability. The company regularly improves its AI training models to ensure nothing is missed, erring on the side of giving users more information rather than less. Meanwhile, StrataReports co-founder Tavassoli said his company’s services are provided on an “as is” basis. He said his technology’s systematic approach makes it more accurate than manual reviews of strata document packages. Even after using an AI tool, manual reviews may still be worthwhile for an additional layer of verification. But manual reviews could prove difficult for especially voluminous or disjointed document packages. Tavassoli once saw a package consisting of 2,400 pages dating back to 2010. Ultimately, reviews by humans and technology-led ones may both be vulnerable to some imperfection. “You cannot guarantee 100 per cent on anything,” Tavassoli said.

Title: The internet is rife with fake reviews. Will AI make it worse?

Content:  The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce novel and detailed online reviews with almost no work has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory, watchdog groups and researchers say. FILE - Online customer reviews for a product are displayed on a computer on April 17, 2019 in New York.(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce novel and detailed online reviews with almost no work has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory, watchdog groups and researchers say. Phony reviewshave long plagued many popular consumer websites,such as Amazonand Yelp. They are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback. But AI-infused text generation tools, popularized by OpenAI’sChatGPT, enable fraudsters to produce reviews faster and in greater volume, according to tech industry experts. The deceptive practice, which isillegal in the U.S., is carried out year-round but becomes a bigger problem for consumers during theholiday shopping season, when many people rely on reviews to help them purchase gifts. Where are AI-generated reviews showing up? Fake reviews are found across a wide range of industries, from e-commerce, lodging and restaurants, to services such as home repairs,medical careand piano lessons. The Transparency Company, a tech company and watchdog group that uses software to detect fake reviews, said it started to see AI-generated reviews show up in large numbers in mid-2023 and they have multiplied ever since. For a report released this month, The Transparency Company analyzed 73 million reviews in three sectors: home, legal and medical services. Nearly 14% of the reviews were likely fake, and the company expressed a “high degree of confidence” that 2.3 million reviews were partly or entirely AI-generated. “It’s just a really, really good tool for these review scammers,” said Maury Blackman, an investor and advisor to tech startups, who reviewed The Transparency Company’s work and is set to lead the organization starting Jan. 1. In August, software company DoubleVerify said it was observing a “significant increase” in mobile phone and smart TV apps with reviews crafted by generative AI. The reviews often were used to deceive customers into installing apps that could hijack devices or run ads constantly, the company said. The following month, the Federal Trade Commission sued the company behind an AI writing tool and content generator called Rytr, accusing it of offering a service that could pollute the marketplace with fraudulent reviews. The FTC, which this year banned thesale or purchaseof fake reviews, said some of Rytr’s subscribers used the tool to produce hundreds and perhaps thousands of reviews for garage door repair companies, sellers of “replica” designer handbags and other businesses. It’s likely on prominent online sites, too Max Spero, CEO of AI detection company Pangram Labs, said the software his company uses has detected with almost certainty that some AI-generated appraisals posted on Amazon bubbled up to the top of review search results because they were so detailed and appeared to be well thought-out. But determining what is fake or not can be challenging. External parties can fall short because they don’t have “access to data signals that indicate patterns of abuse,” Amazon has said. Pangram Labs has done detection for some prominent online sites, which Spero declined to name due to non-disclosure agreements. He said he evaluated Amazon and Yelp independently. Many of the AI-generated comments on Yelp appeared to be posted by individuals who were trying to publish enough reviews to earn an “Elite” badge, which is intended to let users know they should trust the content, Spero said. The badge provides access to exclusive events with local business owners. Fraudsters also want it so their Yelp profiles can look more realistic, said Kay Dean, a former federal criminal investigator who runs a watchdog group called Fake Review Watch. To be sure, just because a review is AI-generated doesn’t necessarily mean its fake. Some consumers might experiment with AI tools to generate content that reflects their genuine sentiments. Some non-native English speakers say they turn to AI to make sure they use accurate language in the reviews they write. “It can help with reviews (and) make it more informative if it comes out of good intentions,” said Michigan State University marketing professor Sherry He, who has researched fake reviews. She says tech platforms should focus on the behavioral patters of bad actors, which prominent platforms already do, instead of discouraging legitimate users from turning to AI tools. What companies are doing Prominent companies are developing policies for how AI-generated content fits into their systems for removing phony or abusive reviews. Some already employ algorithms and investigative teams to detect and take down fake reviews but are giving users some flexibility to use AI. Spokespeople for Amazon and Trustpilot, for example, said they would allow customers to post AI-assisted reviews as long as they reflect their genuine experience. Yelp has taken a more cautious approach, saying its guidelines require reviewers to write their own copy. “With the recent rise in consumer adoption of AI tools, Yelp has significantly invested in methods to better detect and mitigate such content on our platform,” the company said in a statement. The Coalition for Trusted Reviews, which Amazon, Trustpilot, employment review site Glassdoor, and travel sites Tripadvisor, Expedia andBooking.comlaunched last year, said that even though deceivers may put AI to illicit use, the technology also presents “an opportunity to push back against those who seek to use reviews to mislead others.” “By sharing best practice and raising standards, including developing advanced AI detection systems, we can protect consumers and maintain the integrity of online reviews,” the group said. The FTC’s rulebanning fake reviews, which took effect in October, allows the agency to fine businesses and individuals who engage in the practice. Tech companies hosting such reviews are shielded from the penalty because they are not legally liable under U.S. law for the content that outsiders post on their platforms. Tech companies, including Amazon, Yelp and Google, have sued fake review brokers they accuse of peddling counterfeit reviews on their sites. The companies say their technology has blocked or removed a huge swath of suspect reviews and suspicious accounts. However, some experts say they could be doing more. “Their efforts thus far are not nearly enough,” said Dean of Fake Review Watch. “If these tech companies are so committed to eliminating review fraud on their platforms, why is it that I, one individual who works with no automation, can find hundreds or even thousands of fake reviews on any given day?” Spotting fake AI-generated reviews Consumers can try tospot fake reviewsby watching out for a fewpossible warning signs, according to researchers. Overly enthusiastic or negative reviews are red flags. Jargon that repeats a product’s full name or model number is another potential giveaway. When it comes to AI, research conducted by Balázs Kovács, a Yale professor of organization behavior, has shown that people can’t tell the difference between AI-generated and human-written reviews. Some AI detectors may also be fooled by shorter texts, which are common in online reviews, the study said. However, there are some “AI tells” that online shoppers and service seekers should keep it mind. Panagram Labs says reviews written with AI are typically longer, highly structured and include “empty descriptors,” such as generic phrases and attributes. The writing also tends to include cliches like “the first thing that struck me” and “game-changer.” Error!There was an error processing your request. There was a problem with the recaptcha.

Content: ByAlex Heath,a deputy editor and author of theCommand Linenewsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. Welcome to a special edition ofDecoder. This is Alex Heath, deputy editor atThe Verge. I’m guest hosting for a couple episodes this month as we head into the holidays, and I’m very excited for what we have coming. I’ll be back later this month with an exclusive interview with the CEO of chipmaker Arm, so stay tuned for that. And if you want a sneak peek, be sure to check outCommand Line, my weekly newsletter about the tech industry’s inside conversation. But today, we’re talking about a topic I’ve been focusing on a lot lately. It’s at the heart of the most ambitious and costly gamble the tech industry has arguably ever made. That is, of course, artificial intelligence and, specifically, the idea that one day soon big companies across all kinds of industries will be spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI products. Today, though, that’s just… not happening. AI companies have taken in tens of billions in investment this year alone. OpenAIraiseda staggering $6.6 billion in October, surpassing xAI’s $6 billion fundraise five months earlier. Anthropic justraised another $4 billion from Amazon; the list goes on and on. We’ve heard endless hype from CEOs here onDecoderabout what this technology is supposed to do and why this investment is justified. But so far, the actual spending on AI products nowhere near matches the level of investment being made in the models themselves. According to arecent report from VC firm Menlo Ventures, AI spending is growing fast but hit only $13.8 billion in 2024 — barely covering the year’s two largest AI fundraising rounds from OpenAI and xAI. So, how is this money actually being spent on AI? What are companies actually buying, and what are they doing with it? And why do investors think the return on investment here will one day be worth it? To find out, I caught up with two AI investors: Tim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures who co-authored that report on enterprise AI spending, and Nathan Benaich, author of the “State of AI Report” and founder of Air Street Capital. We dove into the data, the big trends they’re seeing with AI in the enterprise, and where we think this is all going next — including when these AI companies are going to start generating the kinds of profits they’ll need to justify the money they’re already spending.

Title: LLMs, AI Innovation Take Centre Stage at AI Journey 2024
URL: https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-highlights/llms-ai-innovation-take-centre-stage-at-ai-journey-2024/
Image URL: https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-AI-Journey-2024-conference_1-1.jpg
Content: Share Behind every artificial intelligence, no matter how advanced, is the originality of the human mind. TheAI Journeyconference serves as a microcosm of our society, bringing together individuals from all walks of life who engage with AI in various aspects of their work. Each year, the event draws developers and researchers from across the globe, and the 2024 conference, organised by Sberbank in Moscow last week, was no different. It featured presentations on innovative solutions and tools designed to benefit IT specialists. AI Journey serves as a one-stop platform for exploring global trends in AI and IT while also providing industry professionals with an opportunity to discuss the most pressing issues and challenges facing the international community and the tech industry.  Developers are the backbone of AI innovation. Russian developers now have access to GigaView, a new tool based on the GigaCode AI assistant designed to enhance the efficiency of teamwork on software projects. The solution was introduced by Andrey Belevtsev, senior vice president and head of technology development at Sberbank. “In today’s world, it’s extremely important to provide our developers with effective tools for boosting growth in productivity and to give businesses the opportunity to efficiently apply these solutions for process optimisation. GigaView is aimed at automating the most labour-intensive and routine operations and improving the management of the development process. The tool reduces coding errors and makes creating code transparent for all team members,” Belevtsev explained. GigaView is designed to detect potential defects during development and evaluate the quality and productivity of AI projects. Notably, it allows productivity tracking at both the team and individual levels using detailed metrics. The tool is now available on GitVerse, a Russian platform for managing source code. Currently, it supports Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with plans to expand to additional programming languages soon. Belevtsev also highlighted updates to existing tools, including an upcoming upgrade to Sber’s GigaIDE Desktop. This enhanced version of the Russian integrated development environment will enable users to tackle Java project code tasks more efficiently with the help of AI agents, significantly reducing development time. IT professionals will find it easier to locate the project data they need. GigaIDE Desktop has already demonstrated its safety and efficiency during testing by Russian government agencies and has been added to a special register. These new tools might seem exclusive to those with specialised training, but that’s not entirely the case. The AI Journey conference highlighted solutions for professionals across various fields, including the creative industries. One standout example is Kandinsky 4.0 Video, a neural network designed to deliver innovative creative solutions. Sber unveiled the beta version of this next-generation tool that allows users to create realistic video clips from text prompts or a starting frame. With its user-friendly interface, Kandinsky caters to everyone from casual users making amateur videos to designers, videographers, and film animators. It can produce anything from polished video clips to professional-grade project trailers. In just a year since its debut at the previous AI Journey conference, Kandinsky has made significant advancements. Developers have improved the quality of its video output while dramatically increasing generation speed. The model can now transform a user’s idea into a 12-second HD video clip at 1280×720 resolution. For those seeking even faster results, Kandinsky 4.0 Video Flash offers an expedited option capable of creating a video clip in just 15 seconds. This rapid version of the neural network will be available to the public in 2025. “These models, such as Kandinsky Video, are facilitating global development in this important field, taking modern technologies much closer to the synergetic level of information processing, perception and creation possessed by human beings,” Belevtsev further said. Developers believe that many AI technologies should remain open-source as this approach will accelerate the growth of the AI community. A prime example of this philosophy is Sber’s commitment to publishing its artificial intelligence models in open source. The code and weights for several models, including the basic and instructional versions of the fastest model, GigaChat Lite, as well as GigaEmbeddings-instruct – ranked as the top Russian-language model by the ruMTEB benchmark – are now accessible to all users. Sberbank’s chairman,Herman Gref,announced the use of AI in public administration. For the first time, Russia will employ Sber’slarge language model, GigaChat, to process questions submitted by Russian citizens for a live broadcast with their President Vladimir Putin. A highlight of the conference was the introduction of an advanced algorithm for accelerating transport routing. In collaboration with ITMO University, Sber and its AI Laboratory specialists developed the RIDE Python library, which enables faster creation of optimal routes. What sets this solution apart is its ability to improve logistical calculations at scales ranging from city-level to nationwide. The library uses an innovative clustering approach to divide the graph and give developers enhanced control over the quality of their work. This method has been successfully tested in over 500 cities. Shopping on online marketplaces can be a time-consuming task due to the sheer volume of products available. However, developers have created a way to help users quickly navigate through countless items and find the best deals. At the AI Journey conference, researchers from Sberbank’s AI Laboratory introduced new recommendation systems. These systems were trained using open data sets to improve neural networks that assist users in product discovery. The event wasn’t just about current developments; it also laid the groundwork for future collaborations. A major announcement revealed plans for a new Artificial Intelligence Alliance, uniting participants from 18 countries, including the BRICS nations. This initiative seeks to promote the development of AI technologies openly and transparently for everyone’s benefit. Events like AI Journey aim to drive responsible, innovative, and inclusive AI development and tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges by uniting diverse perspectives and encouraging international cooperation.  One of the central themes of the conference was AI’s potential to unite humanity in addressing shared challenges.

Title: Agentic AI is Now On Mid-Sized Indian IT’s Mind
URL: https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-origins-evolution/agentic-ai-is-now-on-mid-sized-indian-its-mind/
Image URL: https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-1.jpg
Content: The era of agentic AI is upon us, and surprisingly, Indian IT is also ready for this revolution. What is even more surprising is the fact that mid-sized and small IT firms are also ready for adoption. As usual, they are taking the acquisition route to achieve these capabilities.The latest example is LTIMindtree. Last week, the IT firmannouncedthat it has committed $6 million to Voicing AI, a US-based startup specialising in human-like AI voice agents. This investment aims to bring human-like voice capability across more than 20 languages with conversational, contextual, and emotional intelligence. Moreover, LTIMindtree hasformedan alliance with GitHub for its Copilot coding tool to train its workforce on the GitHub ecosystem. Similarly, Mphasis has focused on conversational AI to boost user experiences. In July, the IT solutions providerlaunchedNeoCrux, a tool for improving developer productivity by streamlining software developer cycles with AI agents and orchestrators. In October 2023, the company acquired Silverline, a New York-based Salesforce partner, for $132.5 million. During the announcement, Nitin Rakesh, CEO of Mphasis, said, “The acquisition aligns with our strategy to drive customer experience transformation, modernise contact centres, and enable conversational AI automation to meet evolving client needs.” It seems evident that Mphasis has decided to embrace AI and agentic AI for customer interactions as well. Though it is not clear whether the acquisition of Silverline increased Mphasis’s current capabilities, the impact is definitely visible. Persistent Systems, on the other hand, is addressing AI-related privacy challenges. In September, the company acquired Pune-based data privacy consultancy Arrka for ₹14.4 crore ($1.7 million). “Arrka’s mature frameworks and privacy management platform ensure a scalable and governance-driven approach, critical for successful AI implementations,” Persistent Systems CEO Sandeep Kalra said in a press release. Meanwhile, bigger IT giants like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro have decided to develop a different strategy for building AI agents for their customers. In the latest quarterly results, TCS posted $1.5 billion in bookings with AI and Infosys has started buildingsmall language modelsandmulti-agent frameworksfor its clients. A similar situation was observed at Wipro, HCLTech, and Cognizant. TCS, India’s largest IT services exporter, launched a new AI-focused business unit, AI.Cloud, in May,by merging its cloud and AI divisions. Infosys, the second-largest IT firm, unveiled Topaz, an AI suite offering solutions and services. Notably, it has several clients in its portfolio. The mid-sized IT companies are, however, positioning themselves differently here. Speaking withAIM, Nachiket Deshpande, COO at LTIMindtree, said Indian IT firms often do not want to build these capabilities in-house. Commenting on the recent deal with Voicing AI, Deshpande added, “There are so many startups that are coming all around the world. We would want to leverage those startups for those technologies that are coming up.” Deshpande’s biggest reason for not building in-house models is that generative AI is so expensive that it doesn’t make sense to experiment with it while investing so much. “I don’t think the technology in generative AI would be the real differentiator because of the level and the speed of innovation that is happening, whatever technology you may develop will become obsolete within a few months, and you have to keep doing that,” Deshpande said, adding that it requires a lot of capital. Mohandas Pai, the founder of Aarin Capital and former CFO of Infosys, also toldAIMthatIT services companies are not built to invest disproportionate capital R&D. “Indian IT services companies are not product companies.” “Creating an LLM or a big AI model requires large capital, time, a huge computing facility, and a market. All of which India does not have,” Pai pointed out, adding that even though Infosys, TCS, and others might have the funds, their focus is to provide vertical solutions and not horizontal ones like ChatGPT. Similarly, Deshpande also said that the services companies’ P&L is structured differently than that of product companies. “They operate with 80% cross-market, and hence they have the ability to continue to do R&D, and we operate at 30-35% cross-market,” he explained. He believes that if a company invests and builds a particular technology, tomorrow it might become irrelevant. “I need to get 86,000 people to reimagine their work with AI, but I only need 2,000 people to build AI solutions.” “The differentiation of LTIMindtree will lie in terms of how we adopt AI, rather than saying I have another shiny toy which is better than somebody else. Because that differentiation is short-lived,” he added. Apart from the technological capabilities, Deshpande said it’s important that IT companies give startups the space they need to grow on their own. “Hence, acquisition was not the best way, but at a meaningful scale was a better way where we get to leverage the technology, we get to take them to the customer, but also provide those entrepreneurs space to continue their innovation,” he further said. With generative AI systems going autonomous and several big-tech firms announcing models likeDevinand others, Indian IT is also ready to adopt that change quickly. Deshpande said that one of the biggest reasons for this is the outlook on productivity. “The idea of productivity outlook is persona-centric, and you have to look at each persona becoming more and more productive,” Deshpande said. Hence, he said that agentic systems, which do not examine a particular business process or task but the entire persona and try to automate large parts of those personas, are the way to adopt that productivity. That’s why agentic systems are becoming increasingly focused. Earlier this year, small IT firms were taking theacquisition route for building AI capabilities. Happiest Minds, Hexaware, Quest Global, Coforge, Sonata, and GlobalLogic have all announced acquisitions in this space. Now, the conversation has shifted to agentic AI. 📣 Want to advertise in AIM?Book here Explore AIM’s top 10 videos of 2024, showcasing cutting-edge AI innovations, industry leaders, and creative experiments shaping the future.

Title: 2025 tech predictions, according to an IBM executive
URL: https://qz.com/2025-tech-predictions-ibm-ai-1851718389
Image URL: https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/9c8c81c8d3e798f475098f3723ee8991.jpg
Content: Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT two years ago, the tech industry has been consumed by generative artificial intelligence — and the next year will see more businesses adopt the technology, one tech executive predicts. Enterprises are already looking for technology to scale and implement AI, and the focus in 2025 will be on more efficiency and less risk, Hillery Hunter, chief technology officer and general manager of innovation at IBM (IBM) Infrastructure, told Quartz. With cost efficiency in mind, enterprises will likely look for smaller, more targeted generative AI models, Hunter said. Businesses could also turn to ensembles — or combining multiple machine learning or deep learning models for more accurate and robust results — that will allow them “to optimize latency, efficiency and accuracy across their AI workloads,” Hunter said. “For example,” Hunter said, “enterprises would have the option to use smaller, faster and more energy-efficient models on a CPU [core processing unit] as a starting point for data analysis and processing and then use larger models on a GPU [graphics processing unit], as needed, for more complex workloads that require extra performance, all within the same AI Workflow.” In July, Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang said thenext wave of AI is for businesses, and that everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.” “We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.” As the tech industry focuses on launching new AI products, it’s now AI agents, or software that can complete complex tasks autonomously, that have taken over the chatbot hype. Most AI-powered tools that have launched so far are co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, but have to be prompted over and over. In the next year, companies will risk being left behind if they don’t step up their AI efforts, Hunter said. While businesses saw AI become more important this year, they “often struggled with disjointed AI process steps and driving true ROI [return on investment].” Businesses have to bring AI projects together in 2025, Hunter said, or otherwise create “an increasingly bloated tech environment” with more costs and slower innovation. “It’s time for enterprises to kill the Frankencloud — a disjointed environment where data is duplicated and sprawled out across various, disconnected locations — and create the holistic view they need to actually leverage and govern the data and models associated with AI, and generate outcomes that support their AI investment,” Hunter said. Next year will also see enterprises commit to getting out of “tech debt” — debt from failing to modernize IT infrastructure or not having unified IT or cloud-based solutions that are needed to optimize AI. “AI itself will help modernize IT, but in the year ahead, collaboration across the C-suite is going to be key to getting out of this debt,” Hunter said.

Content: published author share on Fake out of home (FOOH) ads have become the industry's new favourite plaything throughout 2024 as we see increased use of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI). From Chinese smartphone brand OPPO taking over the HSBC Rain Vortex in Jewel Changi Airport and turning the waterfall into liquid silver to HBO celebrating the launch ofHouse of the Dragonseason two by plastering Marina Bay Sands' towers and the exterior of the National Gallery with CGI banners, FOOH is everywhere we look. Below are some of the most interesting FOOH ads that took the internet by storm. Don't miss:Are FOOH ads pushing creatives to reimagine their boundaries? 1. Caudalie While the world geared up for the Paris Olympics, French skincare brand Caudalie cleared up the River Seine in a cheeky FOOH social media post. In a video seen on Instagram, the brand's Vinoperfect serum is seen cruising down the river. The serum drips down the edge of the dropper and instantly changes the colour of the river from a dirty green to a shade of blue. As the serum clears the river, green balloons appear out of the water too. The caption accompanying the video said, "Clearing up the Seine of its dark spots, one bottle of Vinoperfect serum at a time." Read morehere. 2. CeraVe American skincare brand CeraVe took over Marina Bay Sands with a new fake out-of-home (FOOH) campaign to celebrate its launch in Singapore in March this year. In one of the video ads for the campaign, the shadow of a giant-sized bottle of CeraVe's moisturising lotion is seen flying over the Singapore flyer. The lotion bottle later peeks out from behind from the Marina Bay Sands building.The bottle then flies above and circles the building before landing on the ground. A giant tub of CeraVe's moisturising cream joins the bottle too. The video ends with the announcement that CeraVe is now available in Singapore. It was created in partnership with Singaporean mixed reality artistAundraj Jude. Read morehere. 3. HBO Go In July this year, landmarks across Asia were taken over by banners supporting Queen Rhaenyra and King Aegon in a fake out of home campaign by HBO GO. The campaign aimed to celebrate the launch ofHouse of the Dragonseason two and invited fans to pledge their allegiance to either side - Team Black for Queen Rhaenyra or Team Green for King Aegon. In addition, various outdoor installations and activations were also held across the region too. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands proudly made a claim for Team Black while the National Gallery's entrance welcomes allies of Team Green with CGI banners. Meanwhile, the King Power Mahanakhon building in Thailand made a stake for Team Green in a CGI banner. In the Philippines, CGI banners were raised at Manila City Hall and the historical Intramuros building. Read morehere. 4. Julie's Biscuits Malaysian snack brand Julie's Biscuits released a fake out-of-home (FOOH) ad featuring its 'Malaysian Swag Pouch', created in collaboration with local streetwear brand Pestle & Mortar Clothing in celebration of Merdeka Day in Malaysia. The FOOH ad sees the pouch atop a striking yellow Julie's truck. The truck then makes its way across Merdeka Square as onlookers pass by the street. The pouch features Malaysian-inspired motifs such as a modern batik design and subtle peanut butter sandwich motifs representative of Julie's Biscuits on the exterior. Meanwhile, the interior features classic Malaysian elements such as a yellow school bus, the Rafflesia plant, durian, iced tea and the Julie's Biscuits peanut butter sandwich.
